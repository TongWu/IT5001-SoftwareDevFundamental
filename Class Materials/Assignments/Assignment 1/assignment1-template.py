############################################

### Part 1: Closed form calculations ###
## Kindly provide the complete expression, you may be penalized
## for giving only the final numerical result.

## a) Quadratic equations (15 marks) ##
# Provide an expression to find the two roots of 1010x^2 + 1009x - 1008 = 0

from math import sqrt

ans1 = 0 # Replace these with your full, complete expressions
ans2 = 0

## b) Snell's law (15 marks) ##
# Find the incidence angle, theta_1, given that theta_2 = 20 degrees,
# n_1 = 1.33 and n_2 = 2.417.

from math import sin, pi

ans = 0 # Replace this with your full, complete expression

### Part 2: Simple Turtle ###

## Warmup ##
# In the following sequences of function calls, try to imagine what will be drawn.
# Then, run the calls yourself on Python. Did it draw what you had expected?
# Uncomment each block to run the commands

## Now you try! (20 marks) ##
# With the functions that you have learnt so far, call a sequence of Turtle
# commands to draw an equilateral triangle with a distance of 300 units on each side,
# with the bottom of the triangle being parallel to the (imaginary) x-axis and
# the bottom left corner of the triangle corresponding to the starting point of turtle.
# Refer to the PDF for an example of how it should be drawn.
