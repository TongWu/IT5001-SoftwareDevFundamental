A mouse took a stroll through the deep dark wood. A fox saw the mouse, and the mouse looked good.
"Where are you going to, little brown mouse? Come and have lunch in my underground house."
"It's terribly kind of you, Fox, but no â€“ I'm going to have lunch with a gruffalo."
"A gruffalo? What's a gruffalo?"
"A gruffalo! Why, didn't you know?
He has terrible tusks, and terrible claws, And terrible teeth in his terrible jaws."
