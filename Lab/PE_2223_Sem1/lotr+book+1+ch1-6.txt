An Unexpected Party

In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with 
the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing 
in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort. 
It  had  a  perfectly  round  door  like  a  porthole,  painted  green,  with  a  shiny 
yellow  brass  knob  in  the  exact middle. The  door  opened  on  to  a  tube-shaped hall 
like  a  tunnel:  a  very  comfortable  tunnel without  smoke, with  panelled walls,  and 
floors  tiled  and  carpeted,  provided with  polished  chairs,  and  lots  and  lots of pegs 
for  hats  and  coats - the hobbit was  fond of visitors. The  tunnel wound on  and on, 
going  fairly  but  not  quite  straight  into  the  side  of  the  hill  -  The  Hill,  as  all  the 
people for many miles round called  it - and many little round doors opened out of 
it,  first  on  one  side  and  then  on  another.  No  going  upstairs  for  the  hobbit: 
bedrooms,  bathrooms,  cellars,  pantries  (lots  of  these),  wardrobes  (he  had  whole 
rooms devoted to clothes), kitchens, dining-rooms, all were on the same floor, and 
indeed  on  the  same  passage. The  best  rooms were  all  on  the  left-hand side (going 
in),  for  these  were  the  only  ones  to  have  windows,  deep-set  round  windows 
looking over his garden and meadows beyond, sloping down to the river.  
This  hobbit  was  a  very  well-to-do  hobbit,  and  his  name  was  Baggins.  The 
Bagginses  had  lived  in  the  neighbourhood  of  The  Hill  for  time  out  of mind,  and 
people considered them very respectable, not only because most of them were rich, 
but  also  because  they  never had  any  adventures or did  anything unexpected: you 
could tell what a Baggins would say on any question without the bother of asking 
him. This  is a story of how a Baggins had an adventure,  found himself doing and 
saying things altogether unexpected. He may have lost the neighbours' respect, but 
he gained-well, you will see whether he gained anything in the end.
The  mother  of  our  particular  hobbit  …  what  is  a  hobbit?  I  suppose  hobbits 
need  some description nowadays,  since  they have become  rare  and  shy of the Big 
People,  as  they  call  us.  They  are  (or  were)  a  little  people,  about  half  our  height, 
and  smaller  than  the  bearded Dwarves. Hobbits  have  no  beards. There  is  little  or 
no  magic  about  them,  except  the  ordinary  everyday  sort  which  helps  them  to 
disappear  quietly  and  quickly  when  large  stupid  folk  like  you  and  me  come 
blundering  along,  making  a  noise  like  elephants  which  they  can  hear  a  mile  off. 
They  are  inclined  to  be    at  in  the  stomach;  they  dress  in  bright  colours  (chiefly 

####-green  and  yellow);  wear  no  shoes,  because  their  feet  grow  natural  leathery  soles 
and thick warm brown hair like the stuff on their heads (which is curly); have long 
clever brown fingers, good-natured faces, and laugh deep fruity laughs (especially 
after  dinner,  which  they  have  twice  a  day when  they  can  get  it). Now  you  know 
enough  to  go  on  with.  As  I  was  saying,  the  mother  of  this  hobbit  -  of  Bilbo 
Baggins, that is  - was  the fabulous Belladonna Took, one of  the  three remarkable 
daughters  of  the  Old  Took,  head  of  the  hobbits  who  lived  across  The Water,  the 
small river that ran at the foot of The Hill. It was often said (in other families) that 
long  ago  one  of  the  Took  ancestors  must  have  taken  a  fairy  wife.  That  was,  of 
course,  absurd,  but  certainly  there  was  still  something  not  entirely  hobbit-like 
about  them,  -  and  once  in  a while members  of  the  Took-clan would go and have 
adventures. They discreetly disappeared, and  the  family hushed  it up; but  the  fact 
remained  that  the  Tooks  were  not  as  respectable  as  the  Bagginses,  though  they 
were undoubtedly richer. Not that Belladonna Took ever had any adventures after 
she  became  Mrs.  Bungo  Baggins.  Bungo,  that  was  Bilbo's  father,  built  the  most 
luxurious  hobbit-hole  for  her  (and  partly  with  her  money)  that  was  to  be  found 
either  under  The  Hill  or  over  The  Hill  or  across  The  Water,  and  there  they 
remained  to  the  end  of  their  days.  Still  it  is  probable  that  Bilbo,  her  only  son, 
although  he  looked  and  behaved  exactly  like  a  second  edition  of  his  solid  and 
comfortable  father,  got  something  a  bit  queer  in  his makeup  from  the Took  side, 
something  that  only  waited  for  a  chance  to  come  out.  The  chance  never  arrived, 
until Bilbo Baggins was grown up, being about fifty years old or so, and living in 
the  beautiful  hobbit-hole  built  by  his  father,  which  I  have  just described  for you, 
until he had in fact apparently settled down immovably.  
By some curious chance one morning long ago in the quiet of the world, when 
there  was  less  noise  and  more  green,  and  the  hobbits  were  still  numerous  and 
prosperous,  and  Bilbo  Baggins  was  standing  at  his  door  after  breakfast  smoking 
an  enormous  long  wooden  pipe  that  reached  nearly  down  to  his  woolly  toes 
(neatly brushed)  - Gandalf  came  by. Gandalf!  If  you  had  heard  only  a  quarter  of 
what  I  have  heard  about  him,  and  I  have  only  heard  very  little  of  all  there  is  to 
hear,  you  would  be  prepared  for  any  sort  I  of  remarkable  tale.  Tales  and 
adventures  sprouted  up  all  over  the  place  wherever  he  went,  in  the  most 
extraordinary  fashion.  He  had  not  been  down  that  way  under  The  Hill  for  ages 
and  ages,  not  since  his  friend  the  Old  Took  died,  in  fact,  and  the  hobbits  had 
almost forgotten what he looked like. He had been away over The Hill and across 
The  Water  on  business  of  his  own  since  they  were  all  small  hobbit-boys  and 
hobbit-girls. 

####-All that the unsuspecting Bilbo saw that morning was an old man with a staff. 
He had a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, a silver scarf over which a white 
beard hung down below his waist, and immense black boots. 
"Good  morning!"  said  Bilbo,  and  he  meant  it.  The  sun  was  shining,  and  the 
grass was very green. But Gandalf looked at him from under long bushy eyebrows 
that  stuck  out  further  than  the  brim  of  his  shady  hat.  "What  do  you  mean?"  be 
said. "Do you wish me a good morning, or mean that it is a good morning whether 
I  want  not;  or  that  you  feel  good  this  morning;  or  that  it  is  morning  to  be  good 
on?" 
"All  of  them  at  once,"  said  Bilbo.  "And  a  very  fine  morning  for  a  pipe  of 
tobacco out of doors, into the bargain. If you have a pipe about you, sit down  and 
have  a  fill of mine! There's no hurry, we have  all  the day before us!" Then Bilbo 
sat down on a seat by his door, crossed his legs, and blew out a beautiful grey ring 
of  smoke  that  sailed  up  into  the  air without  breaking  and  floated  away  over  The 
Hill. 
"Very  pretty!"  said  Gandalf.  "But  I  have  no  time  to  blow  smoke-rings  this 
morning.  I  am  looking  for  someone  to  share  in  an  adventure  that  I  am  arranging, 
and it's very difficult to find anyone." 
«I should think so  - in these parts! We are plain quiet folk and have no use for 
adventures.  Nasty  .disturbing  uncomfortable  things! Make  you  late  for  dinner!  I 
can’t  think  what  anybody  sees  in  them,»  said  our  Mr.  Baggins,  and  stuck  one 
thumb  behind  his  braces,  and  blew  out  another  even  bigger  smoke-ring. Then he 
took out his morning  letters, and begin  to  read, pretending  to  take no more notice 
of  the old man. He had decided  that he was not quite his  sort,  and wanted him  to 
go away. But  the old man did not move. He stood  leaning on his stick and gazing 
at the hobbit without saying anything, till Bilbo got quite uncomfortable and even 
a little cross. 
"Good  morning!"  he  said  at  last.  "We  don't  want  any  adventures  here,  thank 
you! You might try over The Hill or across The Water." By this he meant that the 
conversation was at an end. 
"What a lot of things you do use Good morning for!" said Gandalf. "Now you 
mean that you want to get rid of me, and that it won't be good till I move off." 
"Not  at  all,  not  at  all,  my  dear  sir!  Let  me  see,  I  don't  think  I  know  your 
name?" 
"Yes,  yes,  my  dear  sir  -  and  I  do  know  your  name, Mr.  Bilbo  Baggins.  And 
you  do  know  my  name,  though  you  don't  remember  that  I  belong  to  it.  I  am 

####-Gandalf,  and  Gandalf  means  me!  To  think  that  I  should  have  lived  to  be  good-
morninged by Belladonna Took's son, as if I was selling buttons at the door!" 
"Gandalf,  Gandalf!  Good  gracious  me!  Not  the  wandering  wizard  that  gave 
Old Took a pair of magic diamond studs that fastened themselves and never came 
undone  till  ordered?  Not  the  fellow  who  used  to  tell  such  wonderful  tales  at 
parties, about dragons and goblins and giants and  the rescue of princesses and  the 
unexpected  luck  of  widows'  sons?  Not  the  man  that  used  to  make  such 
particularly  excellent  fireworks!  I  remember  those!  Old  Took  used  to  have  them 
on  Midsummer's  Eve.  Splendid!  They  used  to  go  up  like  great  lilies  and 
snapdragons and laburnums of fire and hang in the twilight all evening!" You will 
notice already that Mr. Baggins was not quite so prosy as he liked to believe, also 
that  he was  very  fond  of  flowers. "Dear me!" she went on. "Not  the Gandalf who 
was  responsible  for so many quiet  lads and  lasses going off  into  the Blue  for mad 
adventures.  Anything  from  climbing  trees  to  visiting  Elves  -  or  sailing  in  ships, 
sailing  to other  shores! Bless me,  life used  to be quite  inter  - I mean, you used  to 
upset things badly in these parts once upon a time. I beg your pardon, but I had no 
idea you were still in business." 
"Where else  should  I be?"  said  the wizard.  "All  the  same  I am pleased  to  find 
you  remember  something about me. You seem  to  remember my  fireworks kindly, 
at any  rate,  land  that  is not without hope.  Indeed  for your old grand-father Took's 
sake, and for the sake of poor Belladonna, I will give you what you asked for." 
"I beg your pardon, I haven't asked for anything!" 
"Yes, you have! Twice now. My pardon. I give it you. In fact I will go so far as 
to  send  you  on  this  adventure.  Very  amusing  for  me,  very  good  for  you  and 
profitable too, very likely, if you ever get over it." 
"Sorry!  I  don't  want  any  adventures,  thank  you.  Not  today.  Good  morning! 
But please come to tea - any time you like! Why not tomorrow? Come tomorrow! 
Good-bye!" 
With  that  the hobbit  turned and  scuttled  inside his  round green door, and  shut 
it as quickly as he dared, not to seen rude. Wizards after all are wizards. 
"What on earth did I ask him to tea for!" he said to him-self, as he went to the 
pantry. He had only  just had break  fast, but he  thought a cake or  two and a drink 
of  something  would  do  him  good  after  his  fright.  Gandalf  in  the  meantime  was 
still  standing  outside  the  door,  and  laughing  long  but  quietly.  After  a  while  he 
stepped  up,  and  with  the  spike  of  his  staff  scratched  a  queer  sign  on  the  hobbit's 
beautiful  green  front-door.  Then  he  strode  away,  just  about  the  time  when  Bilbo 

####-was  finishing  his  second  cake  and  beginning  to  think  that  he  had  escape 
adventures very well. 
The  next  day  he  had  almost  forgotten  about  Gandalf  He  did  not  remember 
things  very  well,  unless  he  put  them  down  on  his  Engagement  Tablet:  like  this: 
Gandalf ’¥a Wednesday. Yesterday he had been too flustered to do anything of the 
kind. Just before tea-time there came a tremendous ring on the front-door bell, and 
then he remembered! He rushed and put on the kettle, and put out another cup and 
saucer and an extra cake or two, and ran to the door.  
"I am so sorry  to keep you waiting!" he was going  to say, when he saw  that  it 
was not Gandalf at all. It was a dwarf with a blue beard tucked into a golden belt, 
and  very  bright  eyes  under  his  dark-green hood.  As  soon a  the door was opened, 
he pushed inside, just as if he had been expected. 
He hung his hooded cloak on the nearest peg, and "Dwalin at your service!" he 
said with a low bow.  
"Bilbo  Baggins  at  yours!"  said  the  hobbit,  too  surprised  to  ask  any  questions 
for  the  moment.  When  the  silence  that  followed  had  become  uncomfortable,  he 
added:  "I  am  just  about  to  take  tea;  pray  come  and  have  some with me." A  little 
stiff  perhaps,  but  he  meant  it  kindly.  And  what  would  you  do,  if  an  uninvited 
dwarf came and hung his things up in your hall without a word of explanation? 
They had not been at table long, in fact they had hardly reached the third cake, 
when there came another even louder ring at the bell. 
"Excuse me!" said the hobbit, and off he went to the door.  
"So  you  have  got  here  at  last!" was what  he was  going  to  say  to Gandalf  this 
time.  But  it  was  not  Gandalf.  Instead  there  was  a  very  old-looking  dwarf  on  the 
step with a white beard and a scarlet hood; and he too hopped inside as soon as the 
door was open, just as if he had been invited. 
"I  see  they  have  begun  to  arrive  already,"  he  said  when  he  caught  sight  of 
Dwalin's  green  hood  hanging  up.  He  hung  his  red  one  next  to  it,  and  "Balin  at 
your service!" he said with his hand on his breast. 
"Thank  you!"  said  Bilbo with  a  gasp.  It was  not  the  correct  thing  to  say,  but 
they have begun  to  arrive had  flustered him badly. He  liked visitors, but he  liked 
to know  them before  they arrived, and he preferred  to ask  them himself. He had a 
horrible  thought  that  the  cakes might  run  short,  and  then  he-as  the host: he knew 
his duty and stuck to it however painful-he might have to go without. 
"Come  along  in,  and  have  some  tea!"  he  managed  to  say  after  taking  a  deep 
breath. 

####-"A  little  beer  would  suit  me  better,  if  it  is  all  the  same  to  you, my  good  sir," 
said  Balin  with  the  white  beard.  "But  I  don't  mind  some  cake-seed-cake,  if  you 
have any." 
"Lots!"  Bilbo  found  himself  answering,  to  his  own  surprise;  and  he  found 
himself  scuttling  off,  too,  to  the  cellar  to  fill  a  pint  beer-mug, and to the pantry to 
fetch  two  beautiful  round  seed-cakes  which  he  had  baked  that  afternoon  for  his 
after-supper morsel. 
When he got back Balin and Dwalin were  talking at  the  table  like old  friends 
(as  a  matter  of  fact  they  were  brothers).  Bilbo  plumped  down  the  beer  and  the 
cake  in  front  of  them, when  loud  came  a  ring  at  the  bell  again,  and  then  another 
ring. 
"Gandalf for certain this time," he thought as he puffed along the passage. But 
it was not. It was two more dwarves, both with blue hoods, silver belts, and yellow 
beards;  and  each  of  them  carried  a  bag  of  tools  and  a  spade.  In  they  hopped,  as 
soon as the door began to open-Bilbo was hardly surprised at all. 
"What can I do for you, my dwarves?" he said. "Kili at your service!" said the 
one.  "And  Fili!"  added  the  other;  and  they  both  swept  off  their  blue  hoods  and 
bowed. 
"At  yours  and  your  family's!"  replied  Bilbo,  remembering  his  manners  this 
time. 
"Dwalin and Balin here already, I see," said Kili. "Let us join the throng!" 
"Throng!" thought Mr. Baggins. "I don't like the sound of that. I really must sit 
down for a minute and collect my wits, and have a drink." He had only just had a 
sip-in  the  corner,  while  the  four  dwarves  sat  around  the  table,  and  talked  about 
mines  and  gold  and  troubles  with  the  goblins,  and  the  depredations  of  dragons, 
and lots of other things which he did not understand, and did not want to, for they 
sounded much too adventurous-when, ding-dong-a-ling-' dang, his bell rang again, 
as if some naughty little hobbit-boy was trying to pull the handle off. "Someone at 
the  door!"  he  said,  blinking.  "Some  four,  I  should  say  by  the  sound,"  said  Fili. 
"Be-sides, we saw them coming along behind us in the distance." 
The  poor  little  hobbit  sat  down  in  the  hall  and  put  his  head  in  his  hands,  and 
wondered  what  had  happened,  and  what  was  going  to  happen,  and  whether  they 
would all stay  to supper. Then  the bell rang again  louder  than ever, and he had  to 
run  to  the  door.  It  was  not  four  after  all,  t  was  FIVE.  Another  dwarf  had  come 
along while he was wondering in the hall. He had hardly turned the knob, be-x)re 
they were all  inside, bowing and  saying  "at your  service" one after another. Dori, 
Nori,  Ori,  Oin,  and  Gloin  were  their  names;  and  very  soon  two  purple  hoods,  a 

####-grey hood, a brown hood, and a white hood were hanging on the pegs, and off they 
marched  with  their  broad  hands  stuck  in  their  gold  and  silver  belts  to  join  the 
others. Already  it had almost become a  throng. Some called  for ale, and some  for 
porter,  and  one  for  coffee,  and  all  of  them  for  cakes;  so  the hobbit was kept very 
busy for a while. 
A  big  jug  of  coffee  bad  just  been  set  in  the  hearth,  the  seed-cakes were gone, 
and  the  dwarves  were  starting  on  a  round  of  buttered  scones,  when  there  came-a 
loud  knock.  Not  a  ring,  but  a  hard  rat-tat  on  the  hobbit's  beautiful  green  door. 
Somebody was banging with a stick! 
Bilbo  rushed  along  the  passage,  very  angry,  and  altogether  bewildered  and 
bewuthered-this  was  the  most  awkward  Wednesday  he  ever  remembered.  He 
pulled open the door with a jerk, and they all fell in, one on top of the other. More 
dwarves,  four  more!  And  there  was  Gandalf  behind,  leaning  on  his  staff  and 
laughing. He had made quite a dent on the beautiful door; he had also, by the way, 
knocked out the secret mark that he had put there the morning before. 
"Carefully!  Carefully!"  he  said.  "It  is  not  like  you,  Bilbo,  to  keep  friends 
waiting  on  the  mat,  and  then  open  the  door  like  a  pop-gun!  Let  me  introduce 
Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, and especially Thorin!" 
"At your service!" said Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur standing in a row. Then they 
hung  up  two  yellow  hoods  and  a  pale  green  one;  and  also  a  sky-blue one with  a 
long silver tassel. This last belonged to Thorin, an enormously important dwarf, in 
fact  no  other  than  the  great  Thorin  Oakenshield  himself,  who  was  not  at  all 
pleased at falling flat on Bilbo's mat with Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur on top of him. 
For  one  thing  Bombur  was  immensely  fat  and  heavy.  Thorin  indeed  was  very 
haughty,  and  said  nothing  about  service;  but  poor Mr. Baggins  said  he was  sorry 
so  many  times,  that  at  last  he  grunted  "pray  don't  mention  it,"  and  stopped 
frowning. 
"Now we  are  all here!"  said Gandalf,  looking  at  the  row of  thirteen hoods-the 
best  detachable  party  hoods-and his own hat hanging on  the pegs. "Quite a merry 
gathering! 
I hope there is something left for the late-comers to eat and drink! What's that? 
Tea! No thank you! A little red wine, I think, for me." "And for me," said Thorin. 
"And raspberry jam and apple-tart," said Bifur. "And mince-pies and cheese," said 
Bofur.  "And  pork-pie  and  salad,"  said  Bombur.  "And  more  cakes-and  ale-and 
coffee, if you don't mind," called the other dwarves through the door.  

####-"Put  on  a  few  eggs,  there's  a  good  fellow!"  Gandalf  called  after  him,  as  the 
hobbit  stumped  off  to  the  pantries.  "And  just  bring  out  the  cold  chicken  and 
pickles!" 
"Seems  to  know  as  much  about  the  inside  of  my  larders  as  I  do  myself!" 
thought Mr. Baggins, who was  feeling  positively  flummoxed,  and was  beginning 
to wonder whether  a most wretched  adventure  had  not  come  right  into his house. 
By  the  time he had got all  the bottles and dishes and knives and forks and glasses 
and  plates  and  spoons  and  things  piled  up  on  big  trays,  he  was  getting  very  hot, 
and red in the face, and annoyed. 
"Confusticate  and  bebother  these  dwarves!"  he  said  aloud.  "Why  don't  they 
come and lend a hand?" Lo and behold! there stood Balin and Dwalin at the door 
of  the  kitchen,  and  Fili  and Kili  behind  them,  and  before  he  could  say  knife  they 
had  whisked  the  trays  and  a  couple  of  small  tables  into  the  parlour  and  set  out 
everything afresh. 
Gandalf  sat  at  the  head  of  the  party with  the  thirteen,  dwarves  all  round:  and 
Bilbo  sat  on  a  stool  at  the  fireside,  nibbling  at  a  biscuit  (his  appetite  was  quite 
taken away), and trying to look as if this was all perfectly  ordinary and. not in the 
least  an  adventure. The  dwarves  ate  and  ate,  and  talked  and  talked,  and  time  got 
on.  At  last  they  pushed  their  chairs  back,  and  Bilbo  made  a  move  to  collect  the 
plates and glasses. 
"I suppose you will all stay to supper?" he said in his politest unpressing tones. 
"Of  course!"  said Thorin.  "And  after. We  shan't  get  through  the  business  till  late, 
and we must have some music first. Now to clear up!" 
Thereupon  the  twelve  dwarves-not  Thorin,  he  was  too  important,  and  stayed 
talking  to  Gandalf-jumped  to  their  feet  and  made  tall  piles  of  all  the  things.  Off 
they went, not waiting for trays, balancing columns of plates, each with a bottle on 
the  top,  with  one  hand,  while  the  hobbit  ran  after  them  almost  squeaking  with 
fright:  "please  be  careful!"  and  "please,  don't  trouble!  I  can  manage."  But  the 
dwarves only started to sing: 
 

Chip the glasses and crack the plates! 
Blunt the knives and bend the forks! 
That's what Bilbo Baggins hates- 
Smash the bottles and burn the corks! 
 
Cut the cloth and tread on the fat! 
Pour the milk on the pantry floor! 
Leave the bones on the bedroom mat! 

####-Splash the wine on every door! 
 
Dump the crocks in a boiling bawl; 
Pound them up with a thumping pole; 
And when you've finished, if any are whole, 
Send them down the hall to roll ! 
 
That's what Bilbo Baggins hates! 
So, carefully! carefully with the plates! 

 
And  of  course  they  did  none  of  these  dreadful  things,  and  everything  was 
cleaned  and  put  away  safe  as  quick  as  lightning,  while  the  hobbit  was  turning 
round  and  round  in  the middle of  the kitchen  trying  to  see what  they were doing. 
Then  they  went  back,  and  found  Thorin  with  his  feet  on  the  fender  smoking  a 
pipe. He was  blowing  the most  enormous  smoke-rings, and wherever he  told one 
to  go,  it  went-up  the  chimney,  or  behind  the  clock  on  the  man-telpiece,  or  under 
the  table,  or  round  and  round  the  ceiling;  but  wherever  it  went  it  was  not  quick 
enough  to escape Gandalf. Pop! he  sent a  smaller  smoke-ring from his short clay-
pipe  straight  through  each  one  of  Thorin's.  The  Gandalf's  smoke-ring  would  go 
green  and  come  back  to  hover  over  the  wizard's  head.  He  had  quite  a  cloud  of 
them  about  him  already,  and  in  the  dim  light  it  made  him  look  strange  and 
sorcerous. Bilbo stood still and watched-he loved smoke-rings-and then be blushed 
to think how proud he had been yesterday morning of the smoke-rings he had sent 
up the wind over The Hill. 
"Now for some music!" said Thorin. "Bring out the instruments!" 
Kili  and  Fili  rushed  for  their  bags  and  brought  back  little  fiddles; Dori, Nori, 
and Ori brought out flutes from somewhere inside their coats; Bombur produced a 
drum  from  the  hall; Bifur  and Bofur went  out  too,  and  came  back with  clarinets 
that they had left among the walking-sticks Dwalin and Balin said: "Excuse me, I 
left  mine  in  the  porch!"  "Just  bring  mine  in  with  you,"  said  Thorin.  They  came 
back with  viols  as  big  as  themselves,  and with  Thorin’s  harp wrapped  in  a  green 
cloth.  It was  a  beautiful  gold-en harp, and when Thorin struck it the music began 
all  at  once,  so  sudden  and  sweet  that Bilbo  forgot everything else, and was  swept 
away  into dark  lands under  strange moons,  far over The Water and very  far  from 
his hobbit-hole under The Hill. 
The dark came into the room from the little window that opened in the side of 
The  Hill;  the  firelight  flickered-it  was  April-and  still  they  played  on,  while  the 
shadow of Gandalf's beard wagged against the wall. 

####-The  dark  filled  all  the  room,  and  the  fire  died  down,  and  the  shadows  were 
lost,  and  still  they  played  on.  And  suddenly  first  one  and  then  another  began  to 
sing  as  they  played,  deep-throated  singing  of  the  dwarves  in  the  deep  places  of 
their ancient homes; and this is like a fragment of their song, if it can be like their 
song without their music. 
 

Far over the misty mountains cold 
To dungeons deep and caverns old 
We must away ere break of day 
To seek the pale enchanted gold. 
 
The dwarves of yore made mighty spells, 
While hammers fell like ringing bells 
In places deep, where dark things sleep, 
In hollow halls beneath the fells. 
 
For ancient king and elvish lord  
There many a gloaming golden hoard  
They shaped and wrought, and light they caught 
To hide in gems on hilt of sword. 
 
On silver necklaces they strung 
The flowering stars, on crowns they hung 
The dragon-fire, in twisted wire  
They meshed the light of moon and sun. 
 
Far over the misty mountains cold 
To dungeons deep and caverns old 
We must away, ere break of day,  
To claim our long-forgotten gold. 
 
Goblets they carved there for themselves 
And harps of gold; where no man delves 
There lay they long, and many a song 
Was sung unheard by men or elves. 
 
The pines were roaring on the height, 
The winds were moaning in the night. 
The fire was red, it flaming spread; 
The trees like torches biased with light, 
 
The bells were ringing in the dale 
And men looked up with faces pale; 

####-The dragon's ire more fierce than fire  
Laid low their towers and houses frail. 
 
The mountain smoked beneath the moon; 
The dwarves, they heard the tramp of doom. 
They fled their hall to dying -fall 
Beneath his feet, beneath the moon. 
 
Far over the misty mountains grim 
To dungeons deep and caverns dim 
We must away, ere break of day,  
To win our harps and gold from him! 

 
As they sang the hobbit felt the love of beautiful things made by hands and by 
cunning and by magic moving through him, a fierce and jealous love, the desire of 
the  hearts  of  dwarves.  Then  something  Tookish  woke  up  inside  him,  and  he 
wished  to  go  and  see  the  great  mountains,  and  hear  the  pine-trees  and  the 
waterfalls, and explore the caves, and wear a sword instead of a walking-stick. He 
looked  out  of  the  window.  The  stars  were  out  in  a  dark  sky  above  the  trees.  He 
thought  of  the  jewels  of  the  dwarves  shining  in  dark  caverns.  Suddenly  in  the 
wood  beyond  The  Water  a  flame  leapt  up--probably  somebody  lighting  a  wood-
fire-and he thought of plundering dragons settling on his quiet Hill and kindling it 
all  to  flames. He  shuddered;  and  very  quickly  he was  plain Mr.  Baggins  of  Bag-
End, Under-Hill, again. 
He got up trembling. He had less than half a mind to fetch the lamp, and more 
than  half  a  mind  to  pretend  to,  and  go  and  hide  behind  the  beer  barrels  in  the 
cellar,  and  not  come  out  again  until  all  the  dwarves  had  gone  away. Suddenly  he 
found that the music and the singing had stopped, and they were all looking at him 
with eyes shining in the dark. 
"Where  are  you  going?"  said  Thorin,  in  a  tone  that  seemed  to  show  that  he 
guessed both halves of the hobbit's mind. 
"What about a little light?" said Bilbo apologetically.  
"We like the dark," said the dwarves. "Dark for dark business! There are many 
hours before dawn." 
"Of  course!"  said Bilbo,  and  sat down  in  a hurry. He missed  the  stool  and  sat 
in the fender, knocking over the poker and shovel with a crash. 
"Hush!" said Gandalf. "Let Thorin speak!" And this is bow Thorin began. 
"Gandalf,  dwarves  and Mr. Baggins! We  are  not  together  in  the  house  of  our 
friend  and  fellow  conspirator,  this  most  excellent  and  audacious  hobbit-may  the 

####-hair  on  his  toes  never  fall  out!  all  praise  to  his  wine  and  ale!-"  He  paused  for 
breath  and  for  a  polite  remark  from  the  hob-bit,  but  the  compliments were  quite 
lost on-poor Bilbo Baggins, who was wagging his mouth in protest at being called 
audacious  and worst  of  all  fellow  conspirator,  though  no  noise  came  out,  he was 
so flummoxed. So Thorin went on: 
"We  are  met  to  discuss  our  plans,  our  ways,  means,  policy  and  devices.  We 
shall soon before the break of day start on our long journey, a journey from which 
some  of  us,  or  perhaps  all  of  us  (except  our  friend  and  counsellor,  the  ingenious 
wizard Gandalf) may never return. It is a solemn moment. Our object is, I take it, 
well known  to us all. To  the estimable Mr. Baggins, and perhaps  to one or  two of 
the  younger  dwarves  (I  think  I  should  be  right  in  naming  Kili  and  Fili,  for 
instance), the exact situation at the moment may require a little brief explanation-" 
This was  Thorin's  style. He was  an  important  dwarf.  If  he  had  been  allowed, 
he  would  probably  have  gone  on  like  this  until  he  was  out  of  breath,  without 
telling  any  one  there  'anything  that  was  not  known  already.  But  he  was  rudely 
interrupted. Poor Bilbo couldn't bear  it any  longer. At may never  return he began 
to feel a shriek coming up  inside, and very soon  it burst out  like  the whistle of an 
engine coming out of a tunnel. All the dwarves sprang Bp knocking over the table. 
Gandalf struck a blue  light on  the end of his magic staff, and  in  its firework glare 
the poor little hobbit could be seen kneeling on the hearth-rug, shaking like a jelly 
that was melting. Then he fell flat on  the floor, and kept on calling out  "struck by 
lightning,  struck  by  lightning!"  over  and  over  again;  and  that  was  all  they  could 
get  out  of  him  for  a  long  time.  So  they  took  him  and  laid  him  out  of  the way  on 
the drawing-room sofa with a drink at his elbow, and they went back to their dark 
business. 
"Excitable  little  fellow,"  said  Gandalf,  as  they  sat  down  again.  "Gets  funny 
queer  fits,  but  he  is  one  of  the  best,  one  of  the  best-as  fierce  as  a  dragon  in  a 
pinch." 
If  you  have  ever  seen  a  dragon  in  a  pinch,  you will  realize  that  this was  only 
poetical  exaggeration  applied  to  any  hobbit,  even  to Old Took's  great-granduncle 
Bullroarer, who was so huge (for a hobbit)  that he could ride a horse. He charged 
the  ranks  of  the  goblins  of  Mount  Gram  in  the  Battle  of  the  Green  Fields,  and 
knocked  their  king  Gol-firnbul's  head  clean  off  with  a  wooden  club.  It  sailed  a 
hundred  yards  through  the  air  and  went  down  a  rabbit  hole,  and  in  this  way  the 
battle was won and the game of Golf invented at the same moment. 
In the meanwhile, however, Bullroarer's gentler descendant was reviving in the 
drawing-room.  After  a  while  and  a  drink  he  crept  nervously  to  the  door  of  the 

####-parlour. This is what he heard, Gloin speaking: "Humph!" (or some snort more or 
less  like  that).  "Will  he  do,  do  you  think?  It  is  all  very  well  for Gandalf  to  talk 
about  this hobbit being  fierce, but one  shriek  like  that  in a moment of excitement 
would be enough  to wake  the dragon and all his  relatives, and kill  the  lot of us.  I 
think it sounded more like fright than excitement! In fact, if it bad not been for the 
sign  on  the  door,  I  should  have  been  sure  we  had  come  to  the  wrong  house.  As 
soon  as  I  clapped  eyes  on  the  little  fellow  bobbing  and  puffing  on  the mat,  I  had 
my doubts. He looks more like a grocer-than a burglar!" 
Then Mr. Baggins  turned  the handle and went in. The Took side had won. He 
suddenly  felt  he would  go without  bed  and  breakfast  to  be  thought  fierce. As  for 
little  fellow  bobbing  on  the  mat  it  almost  made  him  really  fierce.  Many  a  time 
afterwards  the  Baggins  part  regretted  what  he  did  now,  and  he  said  to  himself: 
"Bilbo, you were a fool; you walked right in and put your foot in it." 
"Pardon me," he said, "if I have overheard words that you were saying. I don't 
pretend  to  understand  what  you  are  talking  about,  or  your  reference  to  burglars, 
but  I  think  I  am  right  in  believing"  (this  is  what  he  called  being  on  his  dignity) 
"that you  think  I am no good.  I will show you.  I have no signs on my door-it was 
painted  a  week  ago-,  and  I  am quite  sure you have  come  to  the wrong house. As 
soon as  I  saw  your  funny  faces  on  the  door-step,  I had my doubts. But  treat  it as 
the right one. Tell me what you want done, and I will try it, if I have to walk from 
here  to  the East of East and fight  the wild Were-worms in the Last Desert. I bad a 
great-great-great-granduncle once, Bullroarer Took, and —" 
"Yes, yes, but  that was  long ago," said Gloin. "I was  talking about you. And I 
assure  you  there  is  a  mark  on  this  door-the  usual  one  in  the  trade,  or used  to be. 
Burglar  wants  a  good  job,  plenty  of  Excitement  and  reasonable  Reward,  that's 
how  it  is  usually  read.  You  can  say  Expert  Treasure-hunter  instead of Burglar  if 
you like. Some of them do. It's all the same to us. Gandalf told us that there was a 
man of  the  sort  in  these parts  looking  for  a  Job  at once,  and  that he had arranged 
for a meeting here this Wednesday tea-time." 
"Of course there is a mark," said Gandalf. "I put it there myself. For very good 
reasons. You asked me to find the fourteenth man for your expedition, and I chose 
Mr. Baggins.  Just  let  any one say I chose the wrong man or the wrong house, and 
you can stop at  thirteen and have all  the bad  luck you  like, or go back  to digging 
coal." 
He  scowled  so  angrily  at Gloin  that  the  dwarf  huddled  back  in  his  chair;  and 
when  Bilbo  tried  to  open  his  mouth  to  ask  a  question,  he  turned  and  frowned  at 
him and stuck oat his bushy eyebrows, till Bilbo shut his mouth tight with a snap. 

####-"That's  right,"  said  Gandalf.  "Let's  have  no  more  argument.  I  have  chosen  Mr. 
Baggins  and  that  ought  to  !6te  enough  for  all  of  you.  If  I  say  he  is  a  Burglar,  a 
Burglar he is, or will be when the time comes. There is a lot more in him than you 
guess,  and  a  deal  more  than  he  has  any  idea  of  himself.  You  may  (possibly)  all 
live to thank me yet. Now Bilbo, my boy, fetch the lamp, and let's have little light 
on this!" 
On  the  table  in  the  light  of  a  big  lamp  with  a  red  shad  he  spread  a  piece  of 
parchment rather like a map. 
"This was made  by  Thror,  your  grandfather,  Thorin,  he  said  in  answer  to  the 
dwarves' excited questions. "It is a plan of the Mountain." 
"I  don't  see  that  this  will  help  us  much,"  said  Thorin  disappointedly  after  a 
glance. "I remember the Mountain well enough and the lands about it. And I know 
where Mirkwood is, and the Withered Heath where the great dragons bred." 
"There  is  a dragon marked  in  red on  the Mountain,  said Balin,  "but  it will be 
easy enough to find him without that, if ever we arrive there." 
"There  is one point  that you haven't noticed,"  said  the wizard,  "and  that  is  the 
secret  entrance.  You  see  that  rune  on  the  West  side,  and  the  hand  pointing  to  it 
from the other runes?** That marks a hidden passage to the Lower Halls. 
"It may  have  been  secret  once,"  said  Thorin,  "but  how  do  we  know  that  it  is 
secret  any  longer?  Old  Smaug  had  lived  there  long  enough  now  to  find  out 
anything there is to know about those caves." 
"He may-but he can't have used it for years and years. "Why?" 
"Because  it  is  too  small.  'Five  feet  high  the  door  and  three may walk  abreast' 
say  the  runes,  but  Smaug  could  not  creep  into  a  hole  that  size,  not even when he 
was  a  young  dragon,  certainly  not  after  devouring  so  many  of  the  dwarves  and 
men of Dale." 
"It  seems  a  great  big  hole  to me,"  squeaked Bilbo  (who  had  no  experience  of 
dragons  and  only  of  hobbit-holes) He was getting excited and  interested  again, so 
that he forgot to keep his mouth shut. He loved maps, and in his hall there hung a 
large  one  of  the  Country  Round with  all  his  favourite walks marked  on  it  in  red 
ink.  "How  could  such  a  large  door  be  kept  secret  from  everybody  outside,  apart 
from the dragon?" he asked. He was only a little hobbit you must remember.  
"In lots of ways," said Gandalf. "But in what way this one has been hidden we 
don't  know  without  going  to  see.  From  what  it  says  on  the  map  I  should  guess 
there  is  a  closed  door  which  has  been  made  to  look  exactly  like  the  side  of  the 

                                                             
** Look at the maps with this book, and you will see the runes there. 

 

####-Mountain. That is the usual dwarves' method- I think that is right, isn't it?" "Quite 
right," said Thorin. 
"Also," went on Gandalf, "I forgot  to mention  that with  the map went a key, a 
small and curious key. Here it is!" he said, and handed to Thorin a key with a long 
barrel and intricate wards, made of silver. "Keep it safe!" 
"Indeed  I  will,"  said  Thorin,  and  he  fastened  it  upon  a  fine  chain  that  hung 
about his neck and under his jacket. "Now things begin to look more hopeful. This 
news alters them much for-the better. So far we have had no clear idea what to do. 
We  thought  of  going  East,  as  quiet  and  careful  as  we  could,  as  far  as  the  Long 
Lake. After that the trouble would begin." 
"A long time before that, if I know anything about the loads East," interrupted 
Gandalf. 
"We might go from there up along the River Running," went on Thorin taking 
no  notice,  "and  so  to  the  ruins  of Dale-the old  town  in  the valley  there, under  the 
shadow  of  the Mountain. But we  none of us liked the idea of the Front Gate. The 
river  runs  right out of  it  through  the great  cliff  at  the South of  the Mountain,  and 
out of it comes the dragon too-far too often, unless he has changed." 
"That  would  be  no  good,"  said  the  wizard,  "not  without  a  mighty  Warrior, 
even  a  Hero.  I  tried  to  find  one;  but  warriors  are  busy  fighting  one  another  in 
distant  lands,  and  in  this  neighbourhood  heroes  are  scarce,  or  simply  lot  to  be 
found.  Swords  in  these  parts  are  mostly  blunt,  and  axes  are  used  for  trees,  and 
shields  as  cradles  or  dish-covers;  and  dragons  are  comfortably  far-off  (and 
therefore  legendary).  That  is  why  I  settled  on  burglary-especially  when  I 
remembered the existence of a Side-door. And here is our little Bilbo Baggins, the 
burglar,  the  chosen  and  selected  burglar.  So  now  let's  get  on  and  make  some 
plans." 
"Very  well  then,"  said  Thorin,  "supposing  the  burglar-expert  gives  us  some 
ideas or suggestions." He turned with mock-politeness to Bilbo. 
"First  I  should  like  to  know  a  bit  more  about  things,"  said  he,  feeling  all 
confused and a bit shaky inside, but so far still lookishly determined to go on with 
things.  "I mean  about  the  gold  and  the  dragon,  and  all  that,  and  how  it  got  there, 
and who it belongs to, and so on and further." 
"Bless  me!"  said  Thorin,  "haven't  you  got  a  map?  and  didn't  you  hear  our 
song? and haven't we been talking about all this for hours?" 
"All  the  same,  I  should  like  it  all plain  and  clear,"  said he obstinately, putting 
on  his  business  manner  (usually  reserved  for  people  who  tried  to  borrow money 
off him),  and doing his best  to  appear wise  and prudent  and professional  and  live 

####-up  to Gandalf's  recommendation. "Also  I  should  like  to know about  risks, out-of-
pocket  expenses,  time  required  and  remuneration,  and  so  forth"-by  which  he 
meant: "What am I going to get out of it? and am I going to come back alive?" 
"O  very  well,"  said  Thorin.  "Long  ago  in  my  grandfather  Thror's  time  our 
family  was  driven  out  of  the  far  North,  and  came  back  with  all  their  wealth  and 
their tools to this Mountain on the map. It had been discovered by my far ancestor, 
Thrain the Old, but now they mined and they tunnelled and they made huger halls 
and greater workshops  -and  in  addition  I  believe  they  found  a  good  deal  of  gold 
and a great many  jewels  too. Anyway they grew immensely rich and famous, and 
my  grandfather  was  King  under  the  Mountain  again  and  treated  with  great 
reverence  by  the  mortal  men,  who  lived  to  the  South,  and  were  gradually 
spreading  up  the  Running  River  as  far  as  the  valley  overshadowed  by  the 
Mountain.  They  built  the merry  town  of  Dale  there  in  those  days.  Kings  used  to 
send  for  our  smiths,  and  reward  even  the  least  skilful most  richly.  Fathers would 
beg  us  to  take  their  sons  as  apprentices,  and  pay  us  handsomely,  especially  in 
food-supplies, which we  never  bothered  to  grow  or  find  for  ourselves. Altogether 
those were good days for us, and the poorest of us had money to spend and to lend, 
and leisure to make beautiful things just for the. fun of it, not to speak of the most 
marvellous  and  magical  toys,  the  like  of  which  is  not  to  be  found  in  the  world 
now-a-days.  So  my  grandfather's  halls  became  full  of  armour  and  jewels  and 
carvings and cups, and the toy-market of Dale was the wonder of the North. 
"Undoubtedly  that  was  what  brought  the  dragon.  Dragons  steal  gold  and 
jewels, you know, from men and elves and dwarves, wherever they can find them; 
and  they  guard  their  plunder  as  long  as  they  live  (which  is  practically  forever, 
unless they are killed), and never enjoy a brass ring of it. Indeed they hardly know 
a  good  bit  of  work  from  a  bad,  though  they  usually  have  a  good  notion  of  the 
current market value; and they can't make a thing for themselves, not even mend a 
little  loose  scale of  their armour. There were  lots of dragons  in  the North  in  those 
days, and gold was probably getting scarce up there, with the dwarves flying south 
or  getting  killed,  and  all  the  general  waste  and  destruction  that  dragons  make 
going  from  bad  to  worse.  There  was  a  most  specially  greedy,  strong  and  wicked 
worm called Smaug. One day he flew up into the air and came south. The first we 
heard of  it was a noise  like a hurricane coming from  the North, and  the pine-trees 
on  the  Mountain  creaking  and  cracking  in  the  wind.  Some  of  the  dwarves  who 
happened  to  be  outside  (I  was  one  luckily  -a  fine  adventurous  lad  in  those  days, 
always wandering about, and it saved my life that day)-well, from a good way off 
we saw the dragon settle on our mountain in a spout of flame. Then he came down 

####-the slopes and when he reached the woods they all went up in fire. By that time all 
the bells were  ringing  in Dale and  the warriors were arming. The dwarves  rushed 
out  of  their  great  gate;  but  there was  the  dragon waiting  for  them. None  escaped 
that way.  The  river  rushed  up  in  steam  and  a  fog  fell  on Dale, and  in  the  fog  the 
dragon came on them and destroyed most of the warriors-the usual unhappy story, 
it was only too common in those days. Then he went back and crept in through the 
Front  Gate  and  routed  out  all  the  halls,  and  lanes,  and  tunnels,  alleys,  cellars, 
mansions  and passages. After  that  there were no dwarves  left  alive  inside,  and he 
took  all  their  wealth  for  himself.  Probably,  for  that  is  the  dragons'  way,  he  has 
piled it all up in a great heap far inside, and sleeps on it for a bed. Later he used to 
crawl  out  of  the  great  gate  and  come  by  night  to  Dale,  and  carry  away  people, 
especially maidens, to eat, until Dale was ruined, and all the people dead or gone. 
What goes on there now I don't know for certain, but I don't suppose anyone lives 
nearer to the Mountain than the far edge of the Long Lake now-a-days. 
"The  few  of  us  that  were  well  outside  sat  and  wept  in  hiding,  and  cursed 
Smaug;  and  there we were unexpectedly  joined by my  father  and my grandfather 
with singed beards. They looked very grim but they said very little. When I asked 
how  they had got away,  they  told me  to hold my  tongue, and said  that one day  in 
the proper time I should know. After that we went away, and we have had to earn 
our  livings  as  best we  could  up  and  down  the  lands,  often enough sinking as  low 
as  blacksmith-work  or  even  coalmining.  But  we  have  never  forgotten  our  stolen 
treasure. And even now, when I will allow we have a good bit laid by and are not 
so  badly  off"-here Thorin  stroked  the gold  chain  round his neck-"we still mean to 
get it back, and to bring our curses home to Smaug-if we can. 
"I  have  often  wondered  about  my  father's  and  my  grandfather's  escape.  I  see 
now  they  must  have  had  a  private  Side-door  which  only  they  knew  about.  But 
apparently  they made a map, and  I  should  like  to know how Gandalf got hold of 
it, and why it did not come down to me, the rightful heir." 
"I did not 'get hold of it,' I was given it," said the wizard. 
"Your grandfather Thror was killed, you  remember,  in  the mines of Moria by 
Azog the Goblin —" 
"Curse his name, yes," said Thorin. 
"And  Thrain  your  father  went  away  on  the  twenty-first  of  April,  a  hundred 
years ago last Thursday, and has never been seen by you since—" 
"True, true," said Thorin. 
"Well,  your  father  gave me  this  to  give  to  you;  and  if  I have  chosen my own 
time and way of handing it over, you can hardly blame me, considering the trouble 

####-I had to find you. Your father could not remember his own name when he gave me 
the  paper,  and  he  never  told  me  yours;  so  on  the  whole  I  think  I  ought  to  be 
praised and thanked. Here it is," said he handing the map to Thorin. 
"I don't understand," said Thorin, and Bilbo felt he would have liked to say the 
same. The explanation did not seem to explain. 
"Your  grandfather,"  said  the  wizard  slowly  and  grimly,  "gave  the map  to  his 
son for safety before he went  to  the mines of Moria. Your father went away  to  try 
his  luck with  the map after your grandfather was killed; and  lots of adventures of 
a  most  unpleasant  sort  he  had,  but  he  never  got  near  the  Mountain. How  he  got 
there  I  don't  know,  but  I  found  him  a  prisoner  in  the  dungeons  of  the 
Necromancer." 
"Whatever  were  you  doing  there?"  asked  Thorin  with  a  shudder,  and  all  the 
dwarves shivered. 
"Never  you  mind.  I  was  finding  things  out,  as  usual;  and  a  nasty  dangerous 
business it was. Even I, Gandalf, only just escaped. I tried to save your father, but 
it  was  too  late.  He  was  witless  and  wandering,  and  had  forgotten  almost 
everything  except  the  map  and  the  key."  "We  have  long  ago  paid  the  goblins  of 
Moria,"  said  Thorin;  "we  must  give  a  thought  to  the  Necromancer."  "Don't  be 
absurd! He is an enemy quite beyond the powers of all the dwarves put together, if 
they could all be collected again from the four corners of the world. The one thing 
your  father  wished  was  for  his  son  to  read  the map  and  use  the  key.  The  dragon 
and the Mountain are more than big enough tasks for you!" 
"Hear, hear!" said Bilbo, and accidentally said  it aloud, "Hear what?"  they all 
said  turning  suddenly  towards  him,  and  he  was  so  flustered  that  he  answered 
"Hear what I have got to say!" "What's that?" they asked. 
"Well, I should say that you ought to go East and have a look round. After all 
there  is  the Side-door, and dragons must sleep sometimes, I suppose. If you sit on 
the  doorstep  long  enough,  I daresay you will  think of  something. And well, don't 
you  know,  I  think  we  have  talked  long  enough  for  one  night,  if  you  see  what  I 
mean.  What  about  bed,  and  an  early  start,  and  all  that?  I  will  give  you  a  good 
breakfast before you go." 
"Before  we  go,  I  suppose  you  mean,"  said  Thorin.  "Aren't  you  the  burglar? 
And isn't sitting on the door-step your job, not to speak of getting inside the door? 
But  I agree about bed and breakfast.  I  like eggs with my ham, when starting on a 
journey: fried not poached, and mind you don't break 'em." 
After  all  the  others  had  ordered  their  breakfasts  without  so  much  as  a  please 
(which  annoyed  Bilbo  very much),  they  all  got  up.  The  hobbit  had  to  find  room 

####-for  them  all,  and  filled  all  his  spare-rooms  and  made  beds  on  chairs  and  sofas, 
before  he  got  them  all  stowed  and  went  to  his  own  little  bed  very  tired  and  not 
altogether  happy. One  thing  he  did make  his mind  up  about was  not  to  bother  to 
get up very early and cook everybody else's wretched breakfast. The Tookishness 
was  wearing  off,  and  he  was  not  now  quite  so  sure  that  he  was  going  on  any 
journey  in  the morning.  As  he  lay  in  bed  he  could  hear  Thorin  still  humming  to 
himself in the best bedroom next to him: 
 

Far over the misty mountains cold  
To dungeons deep and caverns old  
We must away, ere break of day,  
To find our long-forgotten gold. 

 
Bilbo went  to  sleep with  that  in  his  ears,  and  it  gave  him  very  uncomfortable 
dreams. It was long after the break of day, when he woke up. 

####-Chapter 2
<br>
Roast Mutton 
<br>
 
Up jumped Bilbo, and putting on his dressing-gown went into the dining-room. 
There he saw nobody, but all the signs of a large and hurried breakfast. There was 
a  fearful  mess  in  the  room,  and  piles  of  unwashed  crocks  in  the  kitchen.  Nearly 
every pot and pan he possessed seemed to have been used. The washing-up was so 
dismally real that Bilbo was forced to believe the party of the night before had not 
been part of his bad dreams, as he had rather hoped. Indeed he was really relieved 
after  all  to  think  that  they  had  all  gone  without  him,  and  without  bothering  to 
wake him up ("but with never a thank-you" he thought); and yet in a way he could 
not help feeling just a trifle disappointed. The feeling surprised him. 
"Don't be a fool, Bilbo Baggins!" he said  to himself, "thinking of dragons  and 
all  that  outlandish  nonsense  at  your  age!"  So  be  put  on  an  apron,  lit  fires,  boiled 
water,  and  washed  up.  Then  he  had  a  nice  little  breakfast  in  the  kitchen  before 
turning  out  the  dining-room. By  that  time  the sun was shining; and  the front door 
was  open,  letting  in  a  warm  spring  breeze.  Bilbo  began  to  whistle  loudly  and  to 
forget about the night before. In fact he was just sitting down to a nice little second 
breakfast  in  the  dining-room by  the open window, when  in walked Gandalf.  "My 
dear  fellow,"  said  he,  "whenever  are  you  going  to  come?  What  about  an  early 
start?-and here you are having breakfast, or whatever you call  it, at half past  ten! 
They left you the message, because they could not wait." 
"What message?" said poor Mr. Baggins all in a fluster.  
"Great Elephants!" said Gandalf, "you are not at all yourself this morning-you 
have never dusted the mantel- piece!" 
"What's  that  got  to  do  with  it?  I  have  had  enough  to  do  with  washing  up  for 
fourteen!" 
"If  you  had  dusted  the  mantelpiece  you  would  have  found  this  just under  the 
clock,"  said  Gandalf,  handing  Bilbo  a  note  (written,  of  course,  on  his  own  note-
paper). 
This is what he read: 
 

"Thorin and Company to Burglar Bilbo greeting! 
For  your  hospitality  our  sincerest  thanks,  and  for  your  offer  of 
professional assistance our grateful acceptance. Terms: cash on delivery, up to 
and  not  exceeding  one  fourteenth  of  total  profits  (if  any);  all  traveling 

####-expenses  guaranteed  in  any  event;  funeral  expenses  to  be  defrayed  by  us  or 
our representatives, if occasion arises and the matter is not otherwise arranged 
for. 
"Thinking  it  unnecessary  to  disturb  your  esteemed  repose,  we  have 
proceeded  in  advance  to  make  requisite  preparations,  and  shall  await  your 
respected person at the Green Dragon Inn, Bywater, at II a.m. sharp. Trusting 
that you will be punctual. 
 
"We have the honour to remain 
                                  "Yours deeply 
                                              "Thorin& Co." 

 
"That leaves you just ten minutes. You will have to run," said Gandalf. 
"But—" said Bilbo. 
"No time for it," said the wizard. 
"But—"said Bilbo again. 
"No time for that either! Off you go!" 
To  the  end  of  his  days  Bilbo  could  never  remember  how  he  found  himself 
outside,  without  a  hat,  walking-stick  or  say  money,  or  anything  that  he  usually 
took  when  he  went  out;  leaving  his  second  breakfast  half-finished  and  quite 
unwashed-up,  pushing  his  keys  into  Gandalf's  hands,  and  running  as  fast  as  his 
furry  feet  could  carry  him  down  the  lane,  past  the  great Mill,  across  The Water, 
and then on for a whole mile or more. Very puffed he was, when he got to Bywater 
just  on  the  stroke  of  eleven,  and  found  he  had  come  without  a  pocket-
handkerchief! 
"Bravo!" said Balin who was standing at the inn door looking out for him. 
Just  then  all  the  others  came  round  the  corner  of  the  road  from  the  village. 
They were on ponies, and each pony was  slung about with all kinds of baggages, 
packages, parcels, and paraphernalia. There was a very small pony, apparently for 
Bilbo. 
"Up you two get, and off we go!" said Thorin. 
"I'm  awfully  sorry,"  said Bilbo,  "but  I  have  come without my  hat,  and  I  have 
left my pocket-handkerchief behind, and I haven't got any money. I didn't get your 
note until after 10.45 to be precise." 
"Don't  be  precise,"  said  Dwalin,  "and  don't  worry!  You will  have  to manage 
without pocket-handkerchiefs, and a good many other things, before you get to the 
journey's end. As for a hat, I have got a spare hood and cloak in my luggage." 

####-That's  how  they  all  came  to  start,  jogging  off  from  the  inn  one  fine  morning 
just  before  May,  on  laden  ponies;  and  Bilbo  was  wearing  a  dark-green  hood  (a 
little  weather-stained)  and  a  dark-green cloak borrowed  from Dwalin. They were 
too large for him, and he looked rather comic. What his father Bungo would have 
thought of him, I daren't think. His only comfort was he couldn't be mistaken for a 
dwarf, as he had no beard. 
They had not been riding very long when up came Gandalf very splendid on a 
white  horse.  He  had  brought  a  lot  of  pocket-handkerchiefs,  and Bilbo's  pipe  and 
tobacco.  So  after  that  the  party  went  along  very  merrily,  and  they  told  stories  or 
sang  songs  as  they  rode  forward  all  day,  except  of  course  when  they  stopped  for 
meals. These didn't  come quite  as often  as Bilbo would have  liked  them, but  still 
he began to feel that adventures were not so bad after all. At  first they had passed 
through  hobbit-lands,  a  wild  respectable  country  inhabited  by  decent  folk,  with 
good  roads,  an  inn  or  two,  and  now  and  then  a  dwarf  or  a  farmer  ambling  by  on 
business.  Then  they  came  to  lands where people  spoke  strangely,  and  sang  songs 
Bilbo  had  never  heard  before.  Now  they  had  gone  on  far  into  the  Lone-lands, 
where  there were  no  people  left,  no  inns,  and  the  roads  grew  steadily worse. Not 
far  ahead were  dreary  hills,  rising  higher  and  higher, dark with trees. On some of 
them  were  old  castles  with  an  evil  look,  as  if  they  had  been  built  by  wicked 
people.  Everything  seemed  gloomy,  for  the  weather  that  day  had  taken  a  nasty 
turn. Mostly  it  had  been  as  good  as May  can  be,  even  in  merry  tales, but now  it 
was  cold  and  wet.  In  the  Lone-lands  they  had  to  camp  when  they  could,  but  at 
least  it  had  been  dry.  "To  think  it  will  soon  be  June,"  grumbled  Bilbo  as  he 
splashed  along  behind  the  others  in  a  very  muddy  track.  It  was  after  tea-time;  it 
was  pouring with  rain, and had been all day; his hood was dripping  into his eyes, 
his cloak was full of water;  the pony was  tired and stumbled on stones;  the others 
were  too  grumpy  to  talk.  "And  I'm  sure  the  rain  has  got  into  the  dry  clothes  and 
into  the  food-bags," thought Bilbo. "Bother burgling and everything to do with it! 
I wish  I was at home  in my nice hole by  the  fire, with  the kettle  just beginning  to 
sing!" It was not the last time that he wished that! 
Still  the  dwarves  jogged  on,  never  turning  round  or  taking  any  notice  of  the 
hobbit.  Somewhere  behind  the  grey  clouds  the  sun  must  have  gone  down,  for  it 
began  to  get  dark.  Wind  got  up,  and  the  willows  along  the  river-bank  bent  and 
sighed. I don't know what river it was, a rushing red one, swollen with the rains of 
the  last  few  days,  that  came  down  from  the  hills  and mountains  in  front  of  them. 
Soon it was nearly dark. The winds broke up the grey clouds, and a waning moon 
appeared  above  the  hills  between  the  flying  rags.  Then  they  stopped,  and  Thorin 

####-muttered  something  about  supper,  "and  where  shall  we  get  a  dry  patch  to  sleep 
on?" Not until  then did  they notice  that Gandalf was missing. So far he had come 
all  the way with  them, never  saying  if he was  in  the adventure or merely keeping 
them  company  for  a  while.  He  had  eaten  most,  talked  most,  and  laughed  most. 
But now he simply was not there at all! 
"Just  when  a  wizard  would  have  been  most  useful,  too,"  groaned  Dori  and 
Nori  (who  shared  the hobbit's views about  regular meals, plenty and often). They 
decided in  the end that they would have to camp where they were. So far they had 
not  camped  before  on  this  journey,  and  though  they  knew  that  they  soon  would 
have to camp regularly, when they were among the Misty Mountains and far from 
the  lands  of  respectable  people,  it  seemed  a  bad  wet  evening  to  begin,  on.  They 
moved to a clump of trees, and though it was drier under them, the wind shook the 
rain  off  the  leaves,  and  the  drip,  drip,  was  most  annoying.  Also  the  mischief 
seemed to have got into the fire. Dwarves can make a fire almost anywhere out of 
almost anything, wind or no wind; but they could not do it that night, not even Oin 
and Gloin, who were specially good at it. 
Then one of  the ponies  took  fright at nothing and bolted. He got  into  the  river 
before they could catch him; and before they could get him out again, Fili and Kili 
were  nearly  drowned,  and  all  the  baggage  that  he  carried  was  washed  away  off 
him. Of course it was mostly food, and there was mighty little left for supper, and 
less  for  breakfast.  There  they  all  sat  glum  and wet  and muttering, while Oin  and 
Gloin  went  on  trying  to  light  the  fire,  and  quarrelling  about  it.  Bilbo  was  sadly 
reflecting  that  adventures  are  not  all  pony-rides  in  May-sunshine,  when  Balin, 
who was  always  their  look-out man, said:  "There's a light over there!" There was 
a hill  some way off with  trees on  it, pretty  thick  in parts. Out of  the dark mass of 
the  trees  they  could  now  see  a  light  shining,  a  reddish  comfortable-looking light, 
as  it  might  be  a  fire  or  torches  twinkling.  When  they  had  looked  at  it  for  some 
while,  they  fell  to  arguing.  Some  said  "no"  and  some  said  "yes."  Some  said  they 
could but go and see, and anything was better than little supper, less breakfast, and 
wet  clothes  all  the  night. Others  said:  "These  parts  are  none  too well known, and 
are  too  near  the mountains. Travellers  seldom  come  this way  now. The  old maps 
are  no  use:  things  have  changed  for  the  worse  and  the  road  is  unguarded.    They 
have seldom even heard of the king round here, and the less inquisitive you are as 
you  go  along,  the  less  trouble  you  are  likely  to  find."  Some  said:  "After  all  there 
are  fourteen  of  us."  Others  said:  "Where  has  Gandalf  got  to?"  This  remark  was 
repeated  by  everybody.  Then  the  rain  began  to  pour  down  worse  than  ever,  and 
Oin and Gloin began to fight. That settled it. "After all we have got a burglar with 

####-us,"  they said; and so  they made off,  leading  their ponies (with all due and proper 
caution)  in  the  direction  of  the  light.  They  came  to  the  hill  and  were  soon  in  the 
wood.  Up  the  hill  they  went;  but  there  was  no  proper  path  to  be  seen,  such  as 
might  lead  to  a  house  or  a  farm;  and  do  what  they  could  they  made  a  deal  of 
rustling  and  crackling  and  creaking  (and  a good deal of grumbling  and drafting), 
as they went through the trees in the pitch dark. 
Suddenly  the  red  light  shone  out  very  bright  through  the  tree-trunks  not  far 
ahead.  "Now  it  is  the  burglar's  turn,"  they  said, meaning Bilbo.  "You must  go  on 
and  find  out  all  about  that  light,  and what  it  is  for,  and  if  all  is  perfectly  safe and 
canny," said Thorin to the hobbit. "Now scuttle off, and come back quick, if all is 
well.  If  not,  come  back  if  you  can!  It  you  can't,  hoot  twice  like  a  barn-owl and 
once like a screech-owl, and we will do what we can." 
Off Bilbo had  to go, before he  could explain that he could not hoot even once 
like  any  kind  of  owl  any  more  than  fly  like  a  bat.  But  at  any  rate  hobbits  can 
move quietly  in woods,  absolutely quietly. They  take  a pride  in  it,  and Bilbo had 
sniffed  more  than  once  at  what  he  called  "all  this dwarvish  racket," as  they went 
along,  though  I  don't  sup-pose  you  or  I  would  notice  anything  at  all  on  a  windy 
night,  not  if  the  whole  cavalcade  had  passed  two  feet  off.  As  for  Bilbo  walking 
primly  towards  the  red  light,  I  don't  suppose  even  a  weasel  would  have  stirred  a 
whisker  at  it.  So,  naturally,  he  got  right  up  to  the  fire-for  fire  it  was  without 
disturbing anyone. And this is what he saw. Three very large persons sitting round 
a  very  large  fire  of  beech-logs. They were  toasting mutton  on  long  spits of wood, 
and  licking  the  gravy  off  their  fingers.  There  was  a  fine  toothsome  smell.  Also 
there was a barrel of good drink at hand, and  they were drinking out of  jugs. But 
they were  trolls. Obviously  trolls.  Even Bilbo,  in  spite  of  his  sheltered  life,  could 
see  that:  from  the great heavy  faces of  them, and  their size, and  the shape of  their 
legs, not to mention their language, which was not drawing-room fashion at all, at 
all. 
"Mutton yesterday, mutton today, and blimey, if it don't look like mutton again 
tomorrer," said one of the trolls. 
"Never  a  blinking  bit  of  manflesh  have  we  had  for  long  enough,"  said  a 
second.  "What  the  'ell William was  a-thinkin' of to bring us into these parts at all, 
beats me  - and  the drink  runnin'  short, what's more," he  said  jogging the elbow of 
William, who was taking a pull at his jug. 
William  choked.  "Shut  yer  mouth!"  he  said  as  soon  as  he  could.  "Yer  can't 
expect  folk  to stop here  for ever  just  to be et by you and Bert. You've et a village 
and a half between yer, since we come down from the mountains. How much more 

####-d'yer want? And time's been up our way, when yer'd have said 'thank yer Bill' for a 
nice bit o'  fat valley mutton  like what  this  is." He  took a big bite off a  sheep's  leg 
he was toasting, and wiped his lips on his sleeve. 
Yes, I am afraid trolls do behave like that, even those with only one head each. 
After  hearing  all  this  Bilbo  ought  to  have  done  something  at  once.  Either  he 
should  have  gone  back  quietly  and  warned  his  friends  that  there  were  three  fair-
sized  trolls  at  hand  in  a  nasty  mood,  quite  likely  to  try  toasted  dwarf,  or  even 
pony,  for  a  change;  or  else  he  should  have  done  a  bit  of  good  quick  burgling.  A 
really  first-class  and  legendary  burglar would  at  this  point  have  picked  the  trolls' 
pockets-it  is  nearly  always  worthwhile  if  you  can  manage  it-,  pinched  the  very 
mutton off the spite, purloined the beer, and walked off without their noticing him. 
Others more practical but with less professional pride would perhaps have stuck a 
dagger  into  each  of  them  before  they observed  it. Then  the night could have been 
spent cheerily.  
Bilbo knew  it. He had  read of a good many  things he had never seen or done. 
He  was  very  much  alarmed,  as  well  as  disgusted;  he  wished  himself  a  hundred 
miles away, and yet-and yet somehow he could not go straight back to Thorin and 
Company empty-handed. So he stood and hesitated in the shadows. Of the various 
burglarious  proceedings  he  had  heard  of  picking  the  trolls'  pockets  seemed  the 
least difficult, so at last he crept behind a tree just behind William. 
Bert and Tom went off  to  the barrel. William was having another drink. Then 
Bilbo  plucked  up  courage  and  put  his  little  hand  in William's  enormous  pocket. 
There was a purse in it, as big as a bag to Bilbo. "Ha!" thought he warming to his 
new work as he lifted it carefully out, "this is a beginning!" 
It was! Trolls' purses are the mischief, and this was no exception. " 'Ere, 'oo are 
you?"  it  squeaked,  as  it  left  the  pocket;  and  William  turned  round  at  once  and 
grabbed Bilbo by the neck, before he could duck behind the tree. 
"Blimey, Bert, look what I've copped!" said William. 
"What is it?" said the others coming up. 
"Lumme, if I knows! What are yer?" 
"Bilbo  Baggins,  a  bur—  a  hobbit,"  said  poor  Bilbo,  shaking  all  over,  and 
wondering how to make owl-noises before they throttled him. 
"A  burrahobbit?"  said  they  a  bit  startled.  Trolls  are  slow  in  the  uptake,  and 
mighty suspicious about anything new to them. 
"What's a burrahobbit got to do with my pocket, anyways?" said William. 
"And can yer cook 'em?" said Tom. 
"Yer can try," said Bert, picking up a skewer.  

####-"He wouldn't make  above  a mouthful,"  said William, who  had  already  had  a 
fine supper, "not when he was skinned and boned." 
"P'raps  there  are more  like  him  round  about,  and we might make  a  pie,"  said 
Bert.  "Here  you,  are  there  any  more  of  your  sort  a-sneakin'  in  these  here woods, 
yer  nassty  little  rabbit,"  said  he  looking  at  the  hobbit's  furry  feet;  and  he  picked 
him up by the toes and shook him. 
"Yes,  lots,"  said  Bilbo,  before  he  remembered  not  to  give  his  friends  away. 
"No, none at all, not one," he said immediately afterwards. 
"What  d'yer  mean?"  said  Bert,  holding  him  right  away  up,  by  the  hair  this 
time. 
"What I say," said Bilbo gasping. "And please don't cook me, kind sirs! I am a 
good  cook myself,  and  cook  bet-ter  than  I cook,  if you  see what  I mean.  I'll cook 
beautifully for you, a perfectly beautiful breakfast for you, if only you won't have 
me for supper." 
"Poor  little blighter,"  said William. He had  already had  as much  supper  as he 
could hold; also he had had lots of beer. "Poor little blighter! Let him go!" 
"Not  till  he  says  what  he  means  by  lots  and  none  at  all,"  said  Bert.  "I  don't 
want to have me throat cut in me sleep. Hold his toes in the fire, till he talks!" 
"I won't have it," said William. "I caught him anyway." 
"You're a fat fool, William," said Bert, "as I've said afore this evening." 
"And you're a lout!" 
"And  I won't  take  that  from you. Bill Huggins,"  says Bert, and puts his  fist  in 
William's eye. 
Then  there  was  a  gorgeous  row.  Bilbo  had  just  enough  wits  left,  when  Bert 
dropped  him  on  the  ground,  to  scramble  out  of  the way  of  their  feet,  before  they 
were  fighting  like  dogs,  and  calling  one  another  all  sorts  of  perfectly  true  and 
applicable  names  in  very  loud  voices.  Soon  they  were  locked  in  one  another's 
arms,  and  rolling  nearly  into  the  fire  kicking  and  thumping, while Tom whacked 
at  then  both  with  a  branch  to  bring  them  to  their  senses-and  that  of  course  only 
made  them  madder  than  ever.  That  would  have  been  the  time  for  Bilbo  to  have 
left. But his poor  little  feet had been very  squashed  in Bert's big paw,  and he had 
no  breath  in  his  body,  and  his  head was  going  round;  so  there  he  lay  for  a while 
panting, just outside the circle of firelight. 
Right  in  the middle of  the  fight up  came Balin. The dwarves had heard noises 
from  a  distance,  and  after  wait-ing  for  some  time  for  Bilbo  to  come  back,  or  to 
hoot  like  an  owl,  they  started  off  one  by  one  to  creep  towards  the  light  as  quietly 
as  they  could.  No  sooner  did  Tom  see  Balin  come  into  the  light  than he gave an 

####-awful  howl.  Trolls  simply  detest  the  very  sight  of  dwarves  (uncooked).  Bert  and 
Bill  stopped  fighting  immediately,  and  "a  sack,  Tom,  quick!"  they  said,  before 
Balin,  who  was  wondering  where  in  all  this  commotion  Bilbo  was,  knew  what 
was happening, a sack was over his head, and he was down. 
"There's more  to come yet," said Tom, "or I'm mighty mistook. Lots and none 
at  all,  it  is,"  said  he.  "No  burra-  hobbits,  but  lots  of  these  here  dwarves.  That's 
about the shape of it!" 
"I reckon you 're right," said Bert, "and we'd best get out of the light." 
And  so  they  did.  With  sacks  in  their  hands,  that  they  used  for  carrying  off 
mutton and other plunder, they waited in the shadows. As each dwarf came up and 
looked  at  the  fire,  and  the  spilled  jugs,  and  the  gnawed mutton,  in  surprise,  pop! 
went  a  nasty  smelly  sack  over  his  head,  and  he  was  down.  Soon  Dwalin  lay  by 
Balin, and Fili and Kili together, and Dori and Nori and Ori all in a heap, and Oin 
and Gloin and Bifur and Bofur and Bombur piled uncomfortably near the fire. 
"That'll teach 'em," said Tom; for Bifur and Bombur had given a lot of trouble, 
and fought like mad, as dwarves will when cornered. 
Thorin  came  last-and  he  was  not  caught  unawares.  He  came  expecting 
mischief,  and  didn't  need  to  see  his  friends'  legs  sticking  out  of  sacks  to  tell  him 
that  things were  not  all well. He  stood  outside  in  the  shadows  some way  off,  and 
said: "What's all this trouble? Who has been knocking my people about?" 
"It's  trolls!"  said  Bilbo  from  behind  a  tree.  They  had  forgotten  all  about him. 
"They're hiding in the bushes with sacks," said he. 
"O!  are  they?"  said  Thorin,  and  he  jumped  forward  to  the  fire,  before  they 
could  leap on him. He caught up a big branch all on fire at one end; and Bert got 
that  end  in  his  eye before he could step aside. That put him out of  the battle  for a 
bit.  Bilbo  did  his  best.  He  caught  hold  of  Tom's  leg-as  well  as  he  could,  it  was 
thick  as  a  young  tree-trunk  -but  he  was  sent  spinning  up  into  the  top  of  some 
bushes, when Tom kicked the sparks up in Thorin's face. 
Tom got the branch in his teeth for that, and lost one of the front ones. It made 
him  howl,  I  can  tell  you.  But  just  at  that  moment  William  came  up  behind  and 
popped  a  sack  right  over  Thorin's  head  and  down  to  his  toes.  And  so  the  fight 
ended. A  nice  pickle  they were  all  in  now:  all  neatly  tied  up  in  sacks, with  three 
angry trolls (and two with burns and bashes to remember) sitting by them, arguing 
whether  they  should  roast  them  slowly,  or mince  them  fine  and  boil  them,  or  just 
sit on them one by one and squash them into jelly: and Bilbo up in a bush, with his 
clothes and his skin torn, not daring to move for fear they should hear him. 
 

####-It was  just  then  that Gandalf  came  back. But  no  one  saw  him. The  trolls  had 
just  decided  to  roast  the dwarves now and eat  them  later-that was Bert's idea, and 
after a lot of argument they had all agreed to it. 
"No  good  roasting  'em  now,  it’d  take  all  night,"  said  a  voice.  Bert  thought  it 
was William's. 
"Don't  start  the  argument  all  over-again.  Bill,"  he  said,  "or  it  will  take  all 
night." 
"Who's a-arguing?" said William, who thought it was. Bert that had spoken. 
"You are," said Bert. 
"You're  a  liar,"  said William;  and  so  the  argument  beg  all  over  again.  In  the 
end  they  decided  to  mince  them  fine  and  boil  them. So  they got  a black pot,  and 
they took out their knives. 
"No  good  boiling  'em! We  ain't  got  no  water,  and  it's  a  long  way  to  the  well 
and all," said a voice. Bert and William thought it was Tom's. 
"Shut  up!"  said  they,  "or  we'll  never  have  done.  And  yer  can  fetch  the water 
yerself, if yer say any more." 
"Shut  up  yerself!"  said  Tom,  who  thought  it  was  William's  voice.  "Who's 
arguing but you. I'd like to know." 
"You're a booby," said William. 
"Booby yerself!" said Tom. 
And  so  the  argument  began  all  over again, and went on hotter than ever, until 
at last they decided to sit on the sacks one by one and squash them, and boil them 
next time. 
"Who shall we sit on first?" said the voice. 
"Better sit on  the  last fellow first," said Bert, whose eye had been damaged by 
Thorin. He thought Tom was talking. 
"Don't talk to yerself!" said Tom. "But if you wants to sit on the last one, sit on 
him. Which is he?" 
"The one with the yellow stockings," said Bert. 
"Nonsense, the one with the grey stockings," said a voice like William's. 
"I made sure it was yellow," said Bert. 
"Yellow it was," said William. 
"Then what did yer say it was grey for?" said Bert. 
"I never did. Tom said it." 
"That I never did!" said Tom. "It was you." 
"Two to one, so shut yer mouth!" said Bert. 
"Who are you a-talkin' to?" said William. 

####-"Now  stop  it!"  said  Tom  and  Bert  together.  "The  night's  gettin'  on,  and  dawn 
comes early. Let's get on with it!" 
"Dawn  take  you  all,  and  be  stone  to  you!"  said  a  voice  that  sounded  like 
William's. But  it wasn't. For  just  at  that moment  the  light  came over  the hill,  and 
there  was  a  mighty  twitter  in  the  branches.  William  never  spoke  for  he  stood 
turned  to  stone  as  he  stooped;  and  Bert  and  Tom  were  stuck  like  rocks  as  they 
looked at him. And there they stand to this day,  all alone, unless the birds perch on 
them; for trolls, as you probably know, must be underground before dawn, or they 
go  back  to  the  stuff  of  the  mountains  they  are  made  of,  and  never  move  again. 
That is what had happened to Bert and Tom and William. 
"Excellent!"  said Gandalf, as he  stepped  from behind a  tree, and helped Bilbo 
to  climb  down  out  of  a  thorn-bush.  Then  Bilbo  understood.  It  was  the  wizard's 
voice  that  had  kept  the  trolls  bickering  and  quarrelling,  until  the  light  came  and 
made an end of them. 
The  next  thing  was  to  untie  the  sacks  and  let  out  the  dwarves.  They  were 
nearly  suffocated,  and  very  annoyed:  they  had  not  at  all  enjoyed  lying  there 
listening  to  the  trolls  making  plans  for  roasting  them  and  squashing  them  and 
mincing  them.  They  had  to  hear  Bilbo's  account  of  what  had  happened  to  him 
twice over, before they were satisfied.  
"Silly time to go practising pinching and pocket-picking," said Bombur, "when 
what we wanted was fire and food!" 
"And  that's  just  what  you  wouldn't  have  got  of  those  fellows  without  a 
struggle, in any case," said Gandalf. 
"Anyhow you are wasting time now. Don't you realize that the trolls must have 
a cave or a hole dug  somewhere near  to hide  from  the  sun  in? We must  look  into 
it!" 
They  searched  about,  and  soon  found  the  marks  of  trolls'  stony  boots  going 
away  through  the  trees.  They  followed  the  tracks  up  the  hill,  until  hidden  by 
bushes  they  came  on  a  big  door  of  stone  leading  to  a  cave.  But  they  could  not 
open it, not though they all pushed while Gandalf tried various incantations. 
"Would  this  be  any  good?"  asked  Bilbo,  when  they  were  getting  tired  and 
angry.  "I  found  it  on  the  ground  where  the  trolls  had  their  fight."  He  held  out  a 
largish key, though no doubt William had thought it very small and secret. It must 
have fallen out of his pocket, very luckily, before he was turned to stone. 
"Why on earth didn't you mention it before?" they cried. 
Gandalf  grabbed  it  and  fitted  it  into  the  key-hole. Then  the  stone door  swung 
back  with  one  big  push,  and  they  all  went  inside.  There were  bones  on  the  floor 

####-and  a  nasty  smell  was  in  the  air;  but  there  was  a  good  deal  of  food  jumbled 
carelessly  on  shelves  and  on  the  ground,  among  an  untidy  litter  of  plunder,  of  all 
sorts from brass buttons to pots full of gold coins standing in a corner. There were 
lots  of  clothes,  too,  hanging  on  the  walls-too  small  for  trolls,  I  am  afraid  they 
belonged  to  victims-and  among  them  were  several  swords  of  various  makes, 
shapes,  and  sizes.  Two  caught  their  eyes  particularly,  because  of  their  beautiful 
scabbards  and  jewelled  hilts.  Gandalf  and  Thorin  each  took  one  of  these;  and 
Bilbo took a knife in a leather sheath. It would have made only a tiny pocket-knife 
for a troll, but it was as good as a short sword for the hobbit. 
"These look like good blades," said the wizard, half drawing them and looking 
at them curiously. "They were not made by any troll, nor by any smith among men 
in  these  parts  and  days;  but when we  can  read  the  runes  on  them, we  shall  know 
more about them." 
"Let's  get  out  of  this  horrible  smell!"  said  Fili  So  they  carried  out  the  pots  of 
coins, and such food as was un-touched and looked fit to eat, also one barrel of ale 
which  was  still  full.  By  that  time  they  felt  like  breakfast,  and  being  very  hungry 
they  did  not  turn  their  noses  up  at what  they had got  from  the  trolls'  larder. Their 
own  provisions were  very  scanty. Now  they  had  bread  and  cheese,  and  plenty  of 
ale,  and  bacon  to  toast  in  the  embers  of  the  fire.  After  that  they  slept,  for  their 
night had been disturbed; (and they did nothing more till the afternoon. Then they 
I brought up their ponies, and carried away the pots of gold, and buried them very 
secretly not far from the track by the river, putting a great many spells over them, 
just  in  case  they  ever  had  the-chance  to  come  back  and  recover  them. When  that 
was  done,  they  all  mounted  once  more,  and  jogged  along  again  on  the  path 
towards the East. 
"Where  did  you  go  to,  if  I  may  ask?"  said  Thorin  to  Gandalf  as  they  rode 
along. 
"To look ahead," said he. 
"And what brought you back in the nick of time?" 
"Looking behind," said he. 
"Exactly!" said Thorin; "but could you be more plain?" 
"I  went  on  to  spy  out  our  road.  It  will  soon  become  dangerous  and  difficult. 
Also  I  was  anxious  about  replenishing  our  small  stock  of  provisions.  I  had  not 
gone very far, however, when I met a couple of friends of mine from Rivendell." 
"Where's that?" asked Bilbo, 
"Don't interrupt!" said Gandalf. "You will get there in a few days now, if we're 
lucky, and find out all about it As I was saying I met two of Elrond's people. They 

####-were  hurrying  along  for  fear  of  the  trolls.  It  was  they  who  told  me  that  three  of 
them had come down from the mountains and settled in the woods not far from the 
road;  they  had  frightened  everyone  away  from  the  district,  and  they  waylaid 
strangers. 
"I  immediately had  a  feeling  that  I was wanted back. Looking behind  I  saw  a 
fire  in  the  distance  and  made  for  it.  So  now  you  know.  Please  be  more  careful, 
next time, or we shall never get anywhere!" 
"Thank you!" said Thorin. 

####-<h4>Chapter 3 </h4> <br>
<br>
A Short Rest 
<br>
 
They  did  not  sing  or  tell  stories  that  day,  even  though  the weather  improved; 
nor the next day, nor the day after. They had begun to feel that danger was not far 
away on either side. They camped under the stars, and their horses had more to eat 
than  they had; for there was plenty of grass, but there was not much in their bags, 
even with what  they had got  from  the  trolls. One morning  they  forded a  river at a 
wide  shallow  place  full  of  the  noise  of  stones  and  foam.  The  far  bank  was  steep 
and slippery. When they got to the top of it, leading their ponies, they saw that the 
great mountains had marched down very near to them. Already they I seemed only 
a day's easy journey from the feet of the nearest. Dark and drear it looked, though 
there were patches of sunlight on its brown sides, and behind its shoulders the tips 
of snow-peaks gleamed. 
"Is  that  The  Mountain?"  asked  Bilbo  in  a  solemn  voice,  looking  at  it  with 
round eyes. He had never seen a thing that looked so big before. 
"Of  course  not!"  said  Balin.  "That  is  only  the  beginning  of  the  Misty 
Mountains,  and we  have  to  get  through,  or  over,  or  under  those  somehow,  before 
we  can  come  into  Wilderland  beyond.  And  it  is  a  deal  of  a  way  even  from  the 
other  side  of  them  to  the  Lonely Mountain  in  the  East Where  Smaug  lies on our 
treasure." 
"O!"  said  Bilbo,  and  just  at  that  moment  he  felt  more  fared  than  he  ever 
remembered  feeling  before. He was  thinking  once  again  of  his  comfortable  chair 
before  the  fire  in  his  favourite  sitting-room  in  his  hobbit-hole,  and  of  the  kettle 
singing. Not for the last time! 
Now  Gandalf  led  the  way.  "We  must  not  miss  the  road,  or  we  shall  be  done 
for,"  he  said.  "We  need  food,  for  one  thing,  and  rest  in  reasonable  safety-also it is 
very necessary  to  tackle  the Misty Mountains by  the proper path, or else you will 
get  lost  in  them,  and  have  to  come  back  and  start  at  the  beginning  again  (if  you 
ever get back at all)." 
They asked him where he was making for, and he answered: "You are come to 
the very edge of the Wild, as some of you may know. Hidden somewhere ahead of 
us  is  the  fair valley of Rivendell where Elrond  lives  in  the Last Homely House.  I 
sent a message by my friends, and we are expected." 
That  sounded  nice  and  comforting,  but  they  had  not  got  there  yet,  and  it was 
not  so  easy  as  it  sounds  to  find  the  Last  Homely  House  west  of  the  Mountains. 

####-There  seemed  to  be  no  trees  and  no  valleys  and  no  hills  to  break  the  ground  in 
front  of  them,  only  one  vast  slope  going  slowly  up  and  up  to meet  the  feet  of  the 
nearest  mountain,  a  wide  land  the  colour  of  heather  and  crumbling  rock,  with 
patches and slashes of grass-green and moss-green showing where water might be. 
Morning  passed,  afternoon  came;  but  in  all  the  silent waste  there was  no  sign 
of  any  dwelling.  They  were  growing  anxious,  for  they  now  saw  that  the  house 
might be hidden almost anywhere between them and the mountains. They came on 
unexpected valleys, narrow with deep sides, that opened suddenly at their feet, and 
they  looked  down  surprised  to  see  trees  below  them  and  running  water  at  the 
bottom.  There  were  gullies  that  they  could  almost  leap  over;  but  very  deep  with 
waterfalls in them. There were dark ravines that one could neither jump nor climb 
into. There were bogs, some of them green pleasant places to look at with flowers 
growing  bright  and  tall;  but  a  pony  that  walked  there  with  a  pack  on  its  back 
would never have come out again. 
It was indeed a much wider land from the ford to the mountains than ever you 
would have guessed. Bilbo was astonished. The only path was marked with white 
stones  some  of  which  were  small,  and  others  were  half  covered  with  moss  or 
heather.  Altogether  it  was  a  very  slow  business  following  the  track,  even  guided 
by Gandalf, who seemed to know his way about pretty well. 
His head and beard wagged  this way and  that as he looked for the stones, and 
they  followed  his  head,  but  they  seemed  no  nearer  to  the  end  of  the  search when 
the day began to fail. Tea-time had long gone by, and it seemed supper-time would 
soon  do  the  same.  There  were  moths  fluttering  about,  and  the  light  became  very 
dim,  for  the  moon  had  not  risen.  Bilbo's  pony  began  to  stumble  over  roots  and 
stones.  They  came  to  the  edge  of  a  steep  fall  in  the  ground  so  suddenly  that 
Gandalf s horse nearly slipped down the slope. 
"Here  it  is  at  last!"  he  called,  and  the  others  gathered  round  him  and  looked 
over the edge. They saw a valley far below. They could hear the voice of hurrying 
water in rocky bed at the bottom; the scent of trees was in the air; and there was a 
light  on  the  valley-side across the water. Bilbo never forgot the way they slithered 
and  slipped  in  the  dusk  down  the  steep  zig-zag  path  into  the  secret  valley  of 
Rivendell. The air grew warmer as  they got  lower, and  the  smell of  the pine-trees 
made  him  drowsy,  so  that  every  now  and  again  he  nodded  and  nearly  fell off, or 
bumped  his  nose  on  the  pony's  neck.  Their  spirits  rose  as  they  went  down  and 
down. The  trees changed  to beech and oak, and hire was a comfortable  feeling  in 
the  twilight. The  last green had  almost  faded out of  the grass, when  they  came  at 
length to an open glade not far above the banks of the stream. 

####-"Hrnmm!  it  smells  like  elves!"  thought  Bilbo,  and  he  looked  up  at  the  stars. 
They  were  burning  bright  and  blue.  Just  then  there  came  a  burst  of  song  like 
laughter in the trees: 
 

O! What are you doing, 
And where are you going? 
Your ponies need shoeing! 
The river is flowing! 
O! tra-la-la-lally 
here down in the valley! 
 
O! What are you seeking, 
And where are you making? 
The faggots are reeking, 
The bannocks are baking! 
O! tril-lil-lil-lolly 
the valley is jolly,  
ha! ha! 
 
O! Where are you going 
With beards all a-wagging? 
No knowing, no knowing 
What brings Mister Baggins, 
And Balin and Dwalin  
down into the valley 
in June 
ha! ha! 
 
O! Will you be staying, 
Or will you be flying? 
Your ponies are straying! 
The daylight is dying! 
To fly would be folly,  
To stay would be jolly 
And listen and hark 
Till the end of the dark 
to our tune 
ha! ha.'  

 

####-So  they  laughed  and  sang  in  the  trees;  and  pretty  fair  nonsense  I  daresay  you 
think  it. Not  that  they would  care  they would only  laugh  all  the more  if you  told 
them  so.  They  were  elves  of  course.  Soon  Bilbo  caught  glimpses  of  them  as  the 
darkness deepened. He loved elves, though he seldom met them; but he was a little 
frightened of  them  too. Dwarves don't get on well with  them. Even decent enough 
dwarves  like  Thorin  and  his  friends  think  them  foolish  (which  is  a  very  foolish 
thing to think), or get annoyed with them. For some elves tease them and laugh at 
them, and most of all at their beards. 
"Well,  well!"  said  a  voice.  "Just  look!  Bilbo  the  hobbit  on  a  pony,  my  dear! 
Isn't it delicious!" 
"Most astonishing wonderful!" 
Then  off  they  went  into  another  song  as  ridiculous  as  the  one  I  have  written 
down  in  full. At  last one, a  tall young  fellow, came out  from  the  trees and bowed 
to Gandalf and to Thorin. 
"Welcome to the valley!" he said. 
"Thank you!"  said Thorin a bit gruffly; but Gandalf was already off his horse 
and among the elves, talking merrily with them. 
"You  are  a  little  out  of  your way,"  said  the  elf:  "that  is,  if  you  are making for 
the only path across the water and to the house beyond. We will set you right, but 
you had best get on foot, until you are over the bridge. Are you going to stay a bit 
and  sing  with  us,  or  will  you  go  straight  on?  Supper  is  preparing  over  there," he 
said. "I can smell the Wood-fires for the cooking." 
Tired as he was, Bilbo would have liked to stay awhile. Elvish singing is not a 
thing  to  miss,  in  June  under  the  stars,  not  if  you  care  for  such  things.  Also  he 
would  have  liked  to  have  a  few  private  words  with  these  people  that  seemed  to 
know  his  name  and  all  about  him,  although  he  had  never  been  them  before.  He 
thought  their  opinion  of  his  adventure might  be  interesting. Elves  know  a  lot  and 
are wondrous  folk  for news, and know what  is going on among the peoples of the 
land,  as  quick  as water  flows,  or  quicker. But  the  dwarves were  all  for  supper  as 
soon  'as  possible  just  then,  and  would  not  stay.  On  they  all  went,  leading  their 
ponies, till they were brought to a good path and so at last to the very brink of the 
river.  It  was  flowing  fast  and  noisily,  as  mountain-streams  do  of  a  summer 
evening, when  sun  has  been  all  day  on  the  snow  far  up  above.  There was  only  a 
narrow bridge of stone without a parapet, as narrow as a pony could well walk on; 
and  over  that  they had  to go, slow and careful, one by one, each  leading his pony 
by  the  bridle. The  elves  had  brought  bright  lanterns  to  the  shore,  and  they  sang  a 
merry song as the party went across. 

####-"Don't dip your beard in the foam, father!" they cried to Thorin, who was bent 
almost on to his hands and knees. "It is long enough without watering it." 
"Mind  Bilbo  doesn't  eat  all  the  cakes!"  they  called.  "He  is  too  fat  to  get 
through key-holes yet!" 
"Hush,  hush!  Good  People!  and  good  night!"  said  Gandalf,  who  came  last. 
"Valleys have ears, and some elves have over merry tongues. Good night!" 
And  so  at  last  they  all  came  to  the  Last  Homely  House,  and  found  its  doors 
flung wide. 
Now  it  is  a  strange  thing,  but  things  that  are  good  to  have  and  days  that  are 
good  to spend are soon told about, and not much to listen to; while things that are 
uncomfortable, palpitating, and even gruesome, may make a good tale, and take a 
deal of telling anyway. They stayed long in that good house, fourteen days at least, 
and  they  found  it  hard  to  leave.  Bilbo  would  gladly  have  stopped  there  for  ever 
and  ever-even  supposing  a  wish  would  have  taken  him  right  back  to  his  hobbit-
hole without trouble. Yet there is little to tell about their stay.  
The  master  of  the  house  was  an  elf-friend-one  of  those  people whose  fathers 
came  into  the  strange  stories  before  the  beginning  of History,  the wars  of  the  evil 
goblins and the elves and the first men in the North. In those days of our tale there 
were  still  some  people who  had  both  elves  and  heroes  of  the North  for ancestors, 
and Elrond the master of the house was their chief. He was as noble and as fair in 
face  as  an  elf-lord,  as  strong  as  a warrior,  as wise  as  a wizard,  as  venerable  as  a 
king  of  dwarves,  and  as  kind  as  summer. He  comes  into. many  tales, but his part 
in  the  story  of  Bilbo's  great  adventure  is  only  a  small  one,  though  important,  as 
you  will  see,  if  we  ever  get  to  the  end  of  it.  His  house  was  perfect,  whether  you 
liked  food,  or  sleep,  or  work,  or  story-telling,  or  singing,  or  just  sitting  and 
thinking best, or a pleasant mixture of them all. Evil things did not come into that 
valley.  
I wish I had  time  to  tell you even a few of  the  tales or one or  two of  the songs 
that  they  heard  in  that  house. All  of  them,  the  ponies  as well,  grew  refreshed and 
strong  in  a  few  days  there.  Their  clothes  were  mended  as  well  as  their  bruises, 
their tempers and their hopes. Their bags were filled with food and provisions light 
to  carry  but  strong  to  bring  them  over  the  mountain  passes.  Their  plans  were 
improved  with  the  best  advice.  So  the  time  came  to  mid-  summer  eve,  and  they 
were to go on again with the early sun on midsummer morning. 
Elrond  knew  all  about  runes  of  every  kind. That  day  he  looked  at  the  swords 
they had brought from the trolls' lair, and he said: "These are not troll-make. They 
are old swords, very old swords of the High Elves of the West, my kin. They were 

####-made  in  Gondolin  for  the  Goblin-wars.  They  must  have  come  from  a  dragon's 
hoard  or  goblin  plunder,  for  dragons  and  goblins  destroyed  that  city  many  ages 
ago.  This,  Thorin,  the  runes  name  Orcrist,  the  Goblin-cleaver  in  the  ancient 
tongue  of  Gondolin;  it  was  a  famous  blade.  This,  Gandalf,  was  Glamdring,  Foe-
hammer that the king of Gondolin once wore. Keep them well!" 
"Whence  did  the  trolls  get  them,  I wonder?"  said Thorin  looking at his  sword 
with new interest. 
"I  could  not  say,"  said  Elrond,  "but  one  may  guess  that  your  trolls  had 
plundered other plunderers, or come on the remnants of old robberies in some hold 
in  the mountains  of  the North.  I  have heard  that  there are  still  forgotten  treasures 
of  old  to  be  found  in  the  deserted  caverns  of  the mines  of Moria,  since  the  dwarf 
and goblin war." 
Thorin  pondered  these  words.  "I  will  keep  this  sword  in  honour,"  he  said. 
"May it soon cleave goblins once again!" 
"A  wish  that  is  likely  to  be  granted  soon  enough  in  the  mountains!"  said 
Elrond.  "But  show  me  now  your  map!"  He  took  it  and  gazed  long  at  it,  and  he 
shook  his  head;  for  if  he  did  not  altogether  approve  of  dwarves  and  their  love  of 
gold, he hated dragons and their cruel wickedness, and he grieved to remember the 
ruin  of  the  town  of  Dale  and  its  merry  bells,  and  the  burned  banks  of  the  bright 
River Running. The moon was  shining  in  a  broad  silver  crescent. He  held  up  the 
map  and  the  white  light  shone  through  it.  "What  is  this?"  he  said.  "There  are 
moon-letters  here,  beside  the  plain  runes  which  say  'five  feet  high  the  door  and 
three may walk abreast.' " 
"What  are moon-letters?" asked  the hobbit  full of excitement. He  loved maps, 
as  I  have  told  you  before;  and  he  also  liked  runes  and  letters  and  cunning 
handwriting, though when he wrote himself it was a bit thin and spidery.  
"Moon-letters  are  rune-letters,  but  you  cannot  see  them,"  said  Elrond,  "not 
when  you  look  straight  at  them.  They  can  only  be  seen  when  the  moon  shines 
behind  them,  and what  is more, with  the more  cunning  sort  it must  be  a moon  of 
the  same  shape  and  season  as  the  day  when  they  were  written.  The  dwarves 
invented  them  and  wrote  them  with  silver  pens,  as  your  friends  could  tell  you. 
These  must  have  been  written  on  a midsummer's  eve  in  a  crescent moon,  a  long 
while ago." 
"What  do  they  say?"  asked Gandalf  and Thorin  together,  a  bit  vexed  perhaps 
that even Elrond should have found this out first, though really there had not been 
a  chance  before,  and  there  would  not  have  been  another  until  goodness  knows 
when. 

####-"Stand  by  the  grey  stone  when  the  thrush  knocks,"  read  Elrond,  "and  the 
setting sun with the last light of Durin's Day will shine upon the key-hole." 
"Durin,  Durin!"  said  Thorin.  "He  was  the  father  of  the  fathers  of  the  eldest 
race of Dwarves, the Longbeards, and my first ancestor: I am his heir." 
"Then what is Durin's Day?" asked Elrond. 
"The  first day of  the dwarves' New Year," said Thorin, "is as all should know 
the first, day of the last moon of Autumn on the threshold of Winter. We still call it 
Durin's  Day  when  the  last  moon  of  Autumn  and  the  sun  are  in  the  sky  together. 
But this will not help us much, I fear, for it passes our skill in these days to guess 
when such a time will come again." 
"That remains to be seen," said Gandalf. "Is there any more writing?" 
"None  to  be  seen  by  this  moon,"  said  Elrond,  and  he  gave  the  map  back  to 
Thorin; and then they went down to the water to see the elves dance and sing upon 
the midsummer's eve. 
The  next  morning  was  a  midsummer's  morning  as  fair  and  fresh  as  could  be 
dreamed: blue sky and never a cloud, and the sun dancing on the water. Now they 
rode away amid songs of farewell and good speed, with their hearts ready for more 
adventure,  and  with  a  knowledge  of  the  road  they  must  follow  over  the  Misty 
Mountains to the land beyond. 

####-<h4>Chapter 4 </h4> <br>

Over Hill and Under Hill 

 
There  were  many  paths  that  led  up  into  those  mountains,  and  many  passes 
over them. But most of the paths were cheats and deceptions and led nowhere or to 
bad ends; and most of the passes were infested by evil things and dreadful dangers. 
The  dwarves  and  the  hobbit,  helped  by  the  wise  advice  of  Elrond  and  the 
knowledge and memory of Gandalf, took the right road to the right pass. 
Long  days  after  they  had  climbed  out  of  the  valley  and  left  the  Last  Homely 
House  miles  behind,  they  were  still  going  up  and  up  and  up.  It  was  a  hard  path 
and  a  dangerous  path,  a  crooked  way  and  a  lonely  and  a  long.  Now  they  could 
look  back  over  the  lands  they  had  left,  laid  out  behind  them  far  below.  Far,  far 
away in the West, where things were blue and faint, Bilbo knew there lay his own 
country  of  safe  and  comfortable  things,  and  his  little  hobbit-hole. He shivered.  It 
was  getting  bitter  cold  up  here,  and  the  wind  came  shrill  among  the  rocks. 
Boulders,  too,  at  times  came  galloping  down  the  mountain-sides,  let  loose  by 
midday  sun  upon  the  snow,  and  passed  among  them  (which  was  lucky),  or  over 
their heads (which was alarming). The nights were comfortless and chill, and they 
did not dare  to sing or  talk  too  loud,  for  the echoes were uncanny, and  the silence 
seemed  to  dislike  being  broken-except by  the noise of water and  the wail of wind 
and the crack of stone. 
"The  summer  is  getting  on  down  below,"  thought  Bilbo,  "and  haymaking  is 
going  on  and  picnics. They will  be  harvesting  and  blackberrying,  before we  even 
begin to go down the other side at this rate." And the others were thinking equally 
gloomy  thoughts,  although  when  they  had  said  good-bye  to  Elrond  in  the  high 
hope  of  a  midsummer  morning,  they'  had  spoken  gaily  of  the  passage  of  the 
mountains,  and  of  riding  swift  across  the  lands  beyond.  They  had  thought  of 
coming  to  the  secret  door  in  the  Lonely  Mountain,  perhaps  that  very  next  first 
moon  of  Autumn—"  and  perhaps  it  will  be  Durin's  Day"  they  had  said.  Only 
Gandalf had  shaken his head  and  said nothing. Dwarves had not passed  that way 
for  many  years,  but  Gandalf  had,  and  he  knew  how  evil  and  danger  had  grown 
and  thriven  in  the Wild, since  the dragons had driven men from the lands, and the 
goblins had spread  in secret after  the battle of  the Mines of Moria. Even  the good 
plans  of  wise  wizards  like  Gandalf  and  of  good  friends  like  Elrond  go  astray 
sometimes when  you  are  off  on  dangerous  adventures  over  the Edge  of  the Wild; 
and Gandalf was a wise enough wizard to know it. 

####-He  knew  that  something  unexpected  might  happen,  and  he  hardly  dared  to 
hope  that  they  would  pass  without  fearful  adventure  over  those  great  tall 
mountains  with  lonely  peaks  and  valleys  where  no  king  ruled. They did not. All 
was  well,  until  one  day  they  met  a  thunderstorm  -  more  than  a  thunderstorm,  a 
thunder-battle.  You  know  how  terrific  a  really  big  thunderstorm  can  be  down  in 
the  land  and  in  a  river-valley;  especially  at  times  when  two  great  thunderstorms 
meet  and  clash. More  terrible  still  are  thunder  and  lightning  in  the  mountains  at 
night,  when  storms  come  up  from  East  and  West  and  make  war.  The  lightning 
splinters  on  the  peaks,  and  rocks  shiver,  and  great  crashes  split  the  air  and  go 
rolling  and  tumbling  into  every  cave  and  hollow;  and  the  darkness  is  filled  with 
overwhelming noise and sudden light. 
Bilbo had never seen or imagined anything of the kind. They were high up in a 
narrow place, with a dreadful fall into a dim valley at one side of them. There they 
were  sheltering  under  a  hanging  rock  for  the  night,  and  he  lay  beneath  a  blanket 
and  shook  from  head  to  toe. When  he  peeped  out  in  the  lightning-flashes, he saw 
that  across  the  valley  the  stone-giants  were  out  and  were  hurling  rocks  at  one 
another  for a. game, and catching  them, and  tossing  them down  into  the darkness 
where  they  smashed among  the  trees  far below, or  splintered  into  little bits with a 
bang.  Then  came  a  wind  and  a  rain,  and  the  wind  whipped  the  rain  and  the  hail 
about  in  every  direction,  so  that  an  overhanging  rock  was  no  protection  at  all. 
Soon  they were  getting  drenched  and  their  ponies were  standing with  their  heads 
down  and  their  tails  between  their  legs,  and  some  of  them  were  whinnying  with 
fright.  They  could  hear  the  giants  guffawing  and  shouting  all  over  the 
mountainsides. 
"This won't  do  at  all!"  said Thorin.  "If we  don't  get  blown  off  or  drowned,  or 
struck by lightning, we shall be picked up by some giant and kicked sky-high for a 
football." 
"Well,  if  you  know  of  anywhere  better, take us there!" said Gandalf, who was 
feeling very grumpy, and was far from happy about the giants himself. 
The  end of  their  argument was  that  they  sent Fill  and Kili  to  look  for  a better 
shelter. They had very sharp eyes, and being the youngest of the dwarves by some 
fifty  years  they  usually  got  these  sort  of  jobs  (when  everybody  could  see  that  it 
was  absolutely  no  use  sending Bilbo). There  is  nothing  like  looking,  if  you want 
to find something (or so Thorin said to the young dwarves). You certainly usually 
find  something,  if  you  look,  but  it  is  not  always  quite  the  something  you  were 
after. So it proved on this occasion. 

####-Soon  Fili  and  Kili  came  crawling  back,  holding  on  to  the  rocks  in  the  wind. 
"We have  found a dry cave,"  they said, "not  far  round  the next corner; and ponies 
and all could get inside." 
"Have  you  thoroughly  explored  it?"  said  the wizard, who  knew  that  caves  up 
in the mountains were seldom unoccupied. 
"Yes,  yes!"  they  said,  though  everybody  knew  they  could  not  have  been  long 
about  it;  they had come back too quick. "It isn't all that big, and it does not go far 
back." 
That,  of  course,  is  the  dangerous  part  about  caves:  you  don't  know  how  far 
they  go  back,  sometimes,  or  where  a  passage  behind  may  lead  to,  or  what  is 
waiting for you inside. But now Fili and Kill's news seemed good enough. So they 
all  got  up  and  prepared  to  move.  The  wind  was  howling  and  the  thunder  still 
growling, and  they had a business getting  themselves and  their ponies along. Still 
it was not very far to go, and before long they came to a big rock standing out into 
the path. If you stepped behind, you found a low arch in the side of the mountain. 
There was just room to get the ponies through with a squeeze, when they had been 
unpacked  and  unsaddled.  As  they  passed  under  the  arch,  it was  good  to  hear  the 
wind and the rain outside instead of all about them, and to feel safe from the giants 
and their rocks. But the wizard was taking no risks. He lit up his wand  - as he did 
that  day  in Bilbo's  dining-room  that  seemed  so  long ago,  if you remember—, and 
by its light they explored the cave from end to end. 
It seemed quite a fair size, but not  too  large and mysterious. It had a dry floor 
and some comfortable nooks. At one end there was room for the ponies; and there 
they stood (mighty glad of the change) steaming, and champing in their nosebags. 
Oin  and Gloin wanted  to  light  a  fire  at  the  door  to  dry  their  clothes,  but Gandalf 
would not hear of  it. So  they  spread out  their wet  things on  the  floor, and got dry 
ones out of  their bundles;  then they made their blankets comfortable, got out their 
pipes  and  blew  smoke  rings,  which  Gandalf  turned  into  different  colours  and  set 
dancing  up  by  the  roof  to  amuse  them.  They  talked  and  talked,  and  forgot  about 
the  storm, and discussed what each would  do with his share of the treasure (when 
they got it, which at the moment did not seem so impossible); and so they dropped 
off  to  sleep  one  by  one.  And  that  was  the  last  time  that  they  used  the  ponies, 
packages, baggages, tools and paraphernalia that they had brought with them. 
It  turned  out  a  good  thing  that  night  that  they  had  brought  little  Bilbo  with 
them, after all. For somehow, he could not go  to sleep for a  long while; and when 
he did sleep, he had very nasty dreams. He dreamed that a crack in the wall at the 
back  of  the  cave  got  bigger  and  bigger,  and  opened wider  and wider,  and  he was 

####-very  afraid  but  could  not  call  out  or  do  anything  but  lie  and  look.  Then  he 
dreamed  that  the floor of  the cave was giving way, and he was slipping-beginning 
to fall down, down, goodness knows where to. 
At  that he woke up with a horrible start, and found  that part of his dream was 
true. A crack had opened at the back of the cave, and was already a wide passage. 
He  was  just  in  time  to  see  the  last  of  the  ponies'  tails  disappearing  into  it.  Of 
course  he  gave  a  very  loud  yell,  as  loud  a  yell  as  a  hobbit  can  give,  which  is 
surprising for their size. 
Out  jumped  the  goblins,  big  goblins,  great  ugly-looking  goblins,  lots  of 
goblins,  before  you  could  say  rocks  and  blocks.  There were  six  to each dwarf, at 
least,  and  two  even  for Bilbo;  and  they were  all  grabbed  and  carried  through  the 
crack,  before  you  could  say  tinder  and  flint.  But  not  Gandalf.  Bilbo's  yell  had 
done  that  much  good.  It  had  wakened  him  up  wide  in  a  splintered  second,  and 
when  goblins  came  to  grab  him,  there  was  a  terrible  flash  like  lightning  in  the 
cave, a smell like gunpowder, and several of them fell dead. 
The  crack  closed with  a  snap,  and  Bilbo  and  the  dwarves were  on  the wrong 
side  of  it! Where was Gandalf? Of  that neither they nor the goblins had any idea, 
and  the  goblins  did  not  wait  to  find  out.  It  was  deep,  deep,  dark,  such  as  only 
goblins  that  have  taken  to  living  in  the  heart  of  the  mountains  can  see  through. 
The  passages  there  were  crossed  and  tangled  in  all  directions,  but  the  goblins 
knew  their  way,  as  well  as  you  do  to  the  nearest  post-office;  and  the  way  went 
down and down, and it was most horribly stuffy. The goblins were very rough, and 
pinched  unmercifully,  and  chuckled  and  laughed  in  their  horrible  stony  voices; 
and Bilbo was more  unhappy  even  than when  the  troll  had  picked  him  up  by  his 
toes.  He  wished  again  and  again  for  his  nice  bright  hobbit-hole. Not  for  the  last 
time. 
Now  there  came  a  glimmer  of  a  red  light  before  them.  The  goblins  began  to 
sing,  or  croak,  keeping  time  with  the  flap  of  their  flat  feet  on  the  stone,  and 
shaking their prisoners as well. 
 

Clap! Snap! the black crack! 
Grip, grab! Pinch, nab! 
And down down to Goblin -town  
You go, my lad! 
 
Clash, crash! Crush, smash! 
Hammer and tongs! Knocker and gongs! 
Pound, pound, far underground! 

####-Ho, ho! my lad! 
 
Swish, smack! Whip crack! 
Batter and beat! Yammer and bleat! 
Work, work! Nor dare to shirk, 
While Goblins quaff, and Goblins laugh, 
Round and round far underground 
Below, my lad! 

 
It  sounded  truly  terrifying. The walls  echoed  to  the  clap,  snap!  and  the  crush, 
smash!  and  to  the  ugly  laughter  of  their  ho,  ho! my  lad! The  general meaning  of 
the song was only too plain; for now the goblins took out whips and whipped them 
with  a  swish,  smack!,  and set them running as fast as they could in front of them; 
and  more  than  one  of  the  dwarves  were  already  yammering  and  bleating  like 
anything, when they stumbled into a big cavern. 
It was  lit by a great red fire  in  the middle, and by  torches along  the walls, and 
it  was  full  of  goblins.  They  all  laughed  and  stamped  and  clapped  their  hands, 
when  the  dwarves  (with  poor  little  Bilbo  at  the  back  and  nearest  to  the  whips) 
came  running  in,  while  the  goblin-drivers  whooped  and  cracked  their  whips 
behind. The  ponies were already  there huddled  in a corner; and  there were all  the 
baggages  and  packages  lying  broken  open,  and  being  rummaged  by  goblins,  and 
smelt by goblins, and fingered by goblins, and quarreled over by goblins. 
I  am  afraid  that  was  the  last  they  ever  saw  of  those  excellent  little  ponies, 
including  a  jolly  sturdy  little  white  fellow  that  Elrond  had  lent  to  Gandalf,  since 
his  horse  was  not  suitable  for  the  mountain-paths.  For  goblins  eat  horses  and 
ponies  and  donkeys  (and  other much more  dreadful  things),  and  they are always 
hungry.  Just  now  however  the  prisoners  were  thinking  only  of  themselves.  The 
goblins  chained  their  hands  behind  their  backs  and  linked  them  all  together  in  a 
line  and dragged  them  to  the  far  end of  the  cavern with  little Bilbo  tugging  at the 
end of the row.  
There in the shadows on a large flat stone sat a tremendous goblin with a huge 
head,  and  armed  goblins were  standing  round  him  carrying  the  axes  and  the  bent 
swords that they use. Now goblins are cruel, wicked, and bad-hearted. They make 
no beautiful things, but they make many clever ones. They can tunnel and mine as 
well as any but the most skilled dwarves, when they take the trouble, though they 
are  usually  untidy  and  dirty.  Hammers,  axes,  swords,  daggers,  pickaxes,  tongs, 
and  also  instruments of  torture,  they make very well, or get other people  to make 
to  their design, prisoners and  slaves  that have  to work  till  they die  for want of air 

####-and light. It is not unlikely that they invented some of the machines that have since 
troubled  the  world,  especially  the  ingenious  devices  for  killing  large  numbers  of 
people at once, for wheels and engines and explosions always delighted them, and 
also  not  working  with  their  own  hands  more  than  they  could  help;  but  in  those 
days  and  those  wild  parts  they had not  advanced  (as  it  is  called)  so  far. They did 
not  hate  dwarves  especially,  no  more  than  they  hated  everybody  and  everything, 
and  particularly  the  orderly  and  prosperous;  in  some  parts  wicked  dwarves  had 
even  made  alliances  with  them.  But  they  had  a  special  grudge  against  Thorin's 
people,  because  of  the war which  you  have  heard mentioned,  but which  does  not 
come  into  this  tale; and anyway goblins don't care who  they catch, as  long as  it  is 
done smart and secret, and the prisoners are not able to defend themselves. 
"Who are these miserable persons?" said the Great Goblin. 
"Dwarves, and this!" said one of the drivers, pulling at Bilbo's chain so that he 
fell forward onto his knees. 
"We found them sheltering in our Front Porch." 
"What do you mean by it?" said the Great Goblin turning to Thorin. "Up to no 
good, I'll warrant! Spying on the private business of my people, I guess! Thieves, I 
shouldn't  be  surprised  to  learn!  Murderers  and  friends  of  Elves,  not  unlikely! 
Come! What have you got to say?" 
"Thorin  the  dwarf  at  your  service!"  he  replied-it was merely a polite nothing. 
"Of the things which you suspect and imagine we had no idea at all. We sheltered 
from  a  storm  in what  seemed  a  convenient  cave  and  unused;  nothing was  further 
from  our  thoughts  than  inconveniencing goblins  in any way whatever." That was 
true enough! 
"Urn!"  said  the Great Goblin.  "So you  say! Might  I  ask what you were doing 
up in the mountains at all, and where you were coming from, and where you were 
going to? In fact I should like to know all about you. Not that it willdo you much 
good,  Thorin  Oakenshield,  I  know  too  much  about  your  folk  already;  but  let's 
have the truth, or I will prepare something particularly uncomfortable for you!" 
"We were on a journey to visit our relatives, our nephews and nieces, and first, 
second, and third cousins, and the other descendants of our grandfathers, who live 
on  the  East  side  of  these  truly  hospitable  mountains,"  said  Thorin,  not  quite 
knowing  what  to  say  all  at  once  in  a  moment,  when  obviously  the  exact  truth 
would not do at all. 
"He is a liar, O truly tremendous one!" said one of the drivers. "Several of our 
people  were  struck  by  lightning  in  the  cave,  when  we  invited  these  creatures  to 
come  below;  and  they  are  as  dead  as  stones. Also  he  has  not  explained  this!" He 

####-held out the sword which Thorin had worn, the sword which came from the Trolls' 
lair.  
The Great Goblin gave a truly awful howl of rage when he looked at it, and all 
his soldiers gnashed their teeth, clashed their shields, and stamped. They knew the 
sword at once.  It had killed hundreds of goblins  in  its  time, when  the  fair elves of 
Gondolin hunted them in the hills or did battle before their walls. They had called 
it Orcrist, Goblin-cleaver, but the goblins called it simply Biter. They hated it and 
hated worse any one that carried it. 
"Murderers'  and  elf-friends!"  the  Great  Goblin  shouted.  "Slash  them!  Beat 
them! Bite  them! Gnash  them! Take  them  away  to  dark  holes  full  of  snakes,  and 
never  let  them  see  the  light  again!" He was  in  such  a  rage  that he  jumped off his 
seat and himself rushed at Thorin with his mouth open. 
Just  at  that  moment  all  the  lights  in  the  cavern  went  out,  and  the  great  fire 
went  off  poof!  into  a  tower  of  blue  glowing  smoke,  right  up  to  the  roof,  that 
scattered piercing white sparks all among the goblins. 
The  yells  and  yammering,  croaking,  jibbering  and  jabbering;  howls,  growls 
and curses; shrieking and skriking, that followed were beyond description. Several 
hundred wild  cats  and wolves being  roasted  slowly  alive  together would not have 
compared  with  it.  The  sparks  were  burning  holes  in  the  goblins,  and  the  smoke 
that  now  fell  from  the  roof  made  the  air  too  thick  for  even  their  eyes  to  see 
through. Soon they were falling over one another and rolling in heaps on the floor, 
biting and kicking and fighting as if they had all gone mad. 
Suddenly  a  sword  flashed  in  its  own  light.  Bilbo  saw  it  go  right  through  the 
Great Goblin as he stood dumbfounded in the middle of his rage. He fell dead, and 
the goblin soldiers fled before the sword shrieking into the darkness. 
The  sword  went  back  into  its  sheath.  "Follow  me  quick!"  said  a  voice  fierce 
and  quiet;  and  before Bilbo  understood what  had  happened  he was  trotting  along 
again, as fast as he could trot, at the end of the line, down more dark passages with 
the  yells  of  the  goblin-hall  growing  fainter  behind  him.  A  pale  light  was  leading 
them on. 
"Quicker, quicker!" said the voice. "The torches will soon be relit." 
"Half  a  minute!"  said  Dori,  who  was  at  the  back  next  to  Bilbo,  and  a  decent 
fellow.  He  made  the  hobbit  scramble  on  his  shoulders  as  best  he  could  with  his 
tied  hands,  and  then  off  they  all  went  at  a  run,  with  a  clink-clink  of  chains,  and 
many a stumble, since they had no hands to steady themselves with. Not for a long 
while did  they  stop,  and by  that  time  they must have been  right down  in  the very 
mountain's heart. 

####-Then  Gandalf  lit  up  his  wand.  Of  course  it  was  Gandalf;  but  just  then  they 
were  too busy  to ask how he got  there. He  took out his  sword again, and again  it 
flashed  in  the  dark  by  itself.  It  burned  with  a  rage  that  made  it  gleam  if  goblins 
were  about; now  it was bright  as blue  flame  for delight  in  the killing of  the great 
lord of the cave. It made no trouble whatever of cutting through the goblin-chains 
and  setting  all  the  prisoners  free  as  quickly  as  possible.  This  sword's  name  was 
Glamdring  the  Foe-hammer,  if  you  remember.  The  goblins  just  called  it  Beater, 
and hated it worse than Biter if possible. Orcrist, too, had been saved; for Gandalf 
had brought it along as well, snatching it from one of the terrified guards. Gandalf 
thought of most things; and though he could not do everything, he could do a great 
deal for friends in a tight comer.  
"Are we all here?" said he, handing his sword back to Thorin with a bow. "Let 
me see: one-that's Thorin; two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven; 
where  are  Fili  and  Kili?  Here  they  are,  twelve,  thirteen-and  here's Mr.  Baggins: 
fourteen!  Well,  well!  it  might  be  worse,  and  then  again  it  might  be  a  good  deal 
better. No ponies, and no food, and no knowing quite where we are, and hordes of 
angry goblins just behind! On we go!" 
On  they  went.  Gandalf  was  quite  right:  they  began  to  hear  goblin  noises  and 
horrible cries far behind in the passages they had come through. That sent them on 
faster  than  ever,  and  as  poor Bilbo  could  not  possibly  go  half  as  fast-for dwarves 
can roll along at a tremendous pace, I can tell you, when they have to-they took it 
in turn to carry him on their backs. 
Still  goblins  go  faster  than  dwarves,  and  these  goblins  knew  the  way  better 
(they had made the paths themselves), and were madly angry; so that do what they 
could  the  dwarves  heard  the  cries  and  howls  getting  closer  and  closer.  Soon  they 
could  hear  even  the  flap  of  the  goblin  feet,  many  many  feet which  seemed  only 
just  round  the  last  corner.  The  blink  of  red  torches  could  be  seen  behind  them  in 
the tunnel they were following; and they were getting deadly tired. 
"Why,  O  why  did  I  ever  leave  my  hobbit-hole!"  said  poor  Mr.  Baggins 
bumping up and down on Bombur's back. 
"Why, O why did I ever bring a wretched little hobbit on a treasure hunt!" said 
poor Bombur, who was fat, and staggered along with the sweat dripping down his 
nose in his heat and terror.  
At  this  point  Gandalf  fell  behind,  and  Thorin  with  him.  They  turned  a  sharp 
corner. "About turn!" he shouted. "Draw your sword, Thorin!" 
There was nothing else  to be done; and  the goblins did not  like  it. They came 
scurrying  round  the corner  in  full cry, and  found Goblin-cleaver and Foe-hammer 

####-shining  cold  and  bright  right  in  their  astonished  eyes.  The  ones  in  front  dropped 
their  torches  and  gave  one  yell  before  they  were  killed.  The  ones  behind  yelled 
still  more,  and  leaped  back  knocking  over  those  that  were  running  after  them. 
"Biter  and Beater!"  they  shrieked;  and  soon  they were  all  in  confusion,  and most 
of them were hustling back the way they had come. 
It was quite a  long while before any of  them dared  to  turn  that comer. By  that 
time the dwarves had gone on again, a long, long, way on into the dark tunnels of 
the  goblins'  realm.  When  the  goblins  discovered  that,  they  put  out  their  torches 
and they slipped on soft shoes, and they chose out their very quickest runners with 
the sharpest ears and eyes. These ran forward, as swift as weasels in the dark,  and 
with hardly any more noise than bats. 
That  is  why  neither  Bilbo,  nor  the  dwarves,  nor  even  Gandalf  heard  them 
coming. Nor did they see them. But they were seen by the goblins that ran silently 
up  behind,  for  Gandalf  was  letting  his  wand  give  out  a  faint  light  to  help  the 
dwarves as they went along. 
Quite suddenly Dori, now at the back again carrying Bilbo, was grabbed from 
behind in the dark. He shouted and fell; and the hobbit rolled off his shoulders into 
the blackness, bumped his head on hard rock, and remembered nothing more.

Riddles in the Dark 

 
When Bilbo opened his eyes, he wondered  if he had; for  it was  just as dark as 
with them shut. No one was anywhere near him. Just imagine his fright! He could 
hear nothing, see nothing, and he could feel nothing except the stone of the floor.  
Very slowly he got up and groped about on all fours, till he touched the wall of 
the  tunnel;  but  neither  up  nor  down  it  could  he  find  anything:  nothing  at  all,  no 
sign of goblins, no sign of dwarves. His head was swimming, and he was far from 
certain  even  of  the  direction  they  had  been  going  in  when  he  had  his  fall.  He 
guessed  as well  as  he  could,  and  crawled  along  for  a  good way,  till  suddenly  his 
hand met what felt like a tiny ring of cold metal lying on the floor of the tunnel. It 
was  a  turning  point  in  his  career,  but  he  did  not  know  it.  He  put  the  ring  in  his 
pocket  almost without  thinking;  certainly  it  did  not  seem  of  any  particular  use  at 
the moment. He did not go much  further, but sat down on  the cold  floor and gave 
himself  up  to  complete  miserableness,  for  a  long  while.  He  thought  of  himself 
frying bacon and eggs  in his own kitchen at home  - for he could feel inside that it 
was high time for some meal or other; but that only made him miserabler.  
He could not think what to do; nor could he think what had happened; or why 
he  had  been  left  behind;  or  why,  if  he  had  been  left  behind,  the  goblins  had  not 
caught  him;  or  even  why  his  head  was  so  sore.  The  truth  was  he  had  been  lying 
quiet, out of sight and out of mind, in a very dark corner for a long while. 
After some time he felt for his pipe. It was not broken, and that was something. 
Then  he  felt  for  his  pouch,  and  there  was  some  tobacco  in  it,  and  that  was 
something more. Then he felt for matches and he could not find any at all, and that 
shattered his hopes completely. Just as well for him, as he agreed when he came to 
his senses. Goodness knows what the striking of matches and the smell of tobacco 
would  have  brought  on  him  out  of  dark  holes  in  that  horrible  place.  Still  at  the 
moment he felt very crushed. But in slapping all his pockets and feeling all round 
himself  for matches his hand came on  the hilt of his  little sword  - the little dagger 
that he got from the trolls, and that he had quite forgotten; nor do the goblins seem 
to have noticed it, as he wore it inside his breeches. 
Now  he  drew  it  out.  It  shone  pale  and  dim  before  his  eyes.  "So  it  is  an  elvish 
blade, too," he thought; "and goblins are not very near, and yet not far enough." 
But  somehow  he was  comforted.  It was  rather  splendid  to be wearing  a blade 
made  in Gondolin for  the goblin-wars of which so many songs had sung; and also 

####-he  had  noticed  that  such  weapons made  a  great  impression  on  goblins  that  came 
upon them suddenly.  
"Go  back?"  he  thought.  "No  good  at  all!  Go  sideways?  Impossible!  Go 
forward? Only  thing  to  do! On we  go!"  So  up  he  got,  and  trotted  along with  his 
little sword held in front of him and one hand feeling the wall, and his heart all of 
a patter and a pitter.  
 
Now  certainly  Bilbo  was  in  what  is  called  a  tight  place.  But  you  must 
remember  it  was  not  quite  so  tight  for  him  as  it  would  have  been  for  me  or  for 
you. Hobbits are not quite like ordinary people; and after all if their holes are nice 
cheery  places  and  properly  aired,  quite  different  from  the  tunnels  of  the  goblins, 
still they are more used to tunnelling than we are, and they do not easily lose their 
sense  of  direction  underground-not  when  their  heads  have  recovered  from  being 
bumped.  Also  they  can  move  very  quietly,  and  hide  easily,  and  recover 
wonderfully  from  falls  and  bruises,  and  they  have  a  fund  of  wisdom  and  wise 
sayings that men have mostly never heard or have forgotten long ago. 
I  should  not  have  liked  to  have  been  in Mr. Baggins'  place,  all  the  same. The 
tunnel seemed to have no end. All he knew was that it was still going down pretty 
steadily  and  keeping  in  the  same  direction  in  spite  of  a  twist  and  a  turn  or  two. 
There were passages leading off to the side every now and then, as he knew by the 
glimmer of his sword, or  could feel with his hand on the wall. Of these he took no 
notice,  except  to  hurry  past  for  fear  of  goblins  or  half-imagined  dark  things 
coming out of them. On and on he went, and down and down; and still he heard no 
sound of anything except  the occasional  whirr of a bat by his ears, which  startled 
him at first, till it became too frequent to bother about. I do not know how long he 
kept  on  like  this,  hating  to  go  on,  not  daring  to  stop,  on,  on,  until  he was  tireder 
than tired. It seemed like all the way to tomorrow and over it to the days beyond. 
Suddenly  without  any  warning  he  trotted  splash  into  water!  Ugh!  it  was  icy 
cold. That  pulled  him  up  sharp  and  short. He  did  not  know whether  it was  just  a 
pool in the path, or the edge of an underground stream that crossed the passage, or 
the  brink  of  a  deep  dark  subterranean  lake.  The  sword was  hardly  shining  at  all. 
He  stopped,  and  he  could  hear,  when  he  listened  hard,  drops  drip-drip-dripping 
from an unseen roof into the water below; but there seemed no other sort of sound. 
"So  it  is  a  pool  or  a  lake,  and  not  an  underground  river,"  he  thought.  Still  he 
did  not  dare  to  wade  out  into  the  darkness.  He  could  not  swim;  and  he  thought, 
too,  of  nasty  slimy  things,  with  big  bulging  blind  eyes,  wriggling  in  the  water. 
There  are  strange  things  living  in  the  pools  and  lakes  in  the  hearts  of mountains: 

####-fish whose fathers swam in, goodness only knows how many years ago, and never 
swam out again, while their eyes grew bigger and bigger and bigger from trying to 
see  in  the  blackness;  also  there  are other  things more  slimy  than  fish. Even  in  the 
tunnels  and  caves  the  goblins  have  made  for  themselves  there  are  other  things 
living unbeknown to them that have sneaked in from outside to lie up in the dark. 
Some  of  these  caves,  too,  go  back  in  their  beginnings  to  ages  before  the  goblins, 
who  only  widened  them  and  joined  them  up  with  passages,  and  the  original 
owners are still there in odd comers, slinking and nosing about. 
Deep down here by  the dark water  lived old Gollum, a small slimy creature. I 
don't  know where  he  came  from,  nor who  or what  he was. He was Gollum  — as 
dark  as  darkness,  except  for  two  big  round  pale  eyes  in  his  thin  face.  He  had  a 
little boat, and he rowed about quite quietly on the lake; for lake it was, wide and 
deep  and  deadly  cold.  He  paddled  it  with  large  feet  dangling  over  the  side,  but 
never a ripple did he make. Not he. He was looking out of his pale lamp-like eyes 
for  blind  fish,  which  he  grabbed  with  his  long  fingers  as  quick  as  thinking.  He 
liked  meat  too.  Goblin  he  thought  good,  when  he  could  get  it;  but  he  took  care 
they  never  found  him  out.  He  just  throttled  them  from  behind,  if  they  ever  came 
down  alone  anywhere  near  the  edge  of  the  water,  while  he  was  prowling  about. 
They  very  seldom  did,  for  they  had  a  feeling  that  something  unpleasant  was 
lurking down there, down at the very roots of the mountain. They had come on the 
lake, when  they were  tunnelling down  long ago, and  they  found  they could go no 
further;  so  there  their  road  ended  in  that  direction,  and  there was no  reason  to go 
that  way-unless  the  Great  Goblin  sent  them.  Sometimes  he  took  a  fancy  for  fish 
from the lake, and sometimes neither goblin nor fish came back. 
Actually Gollum  lived on a slimy  island of  rock  in  the middle of  the  lake. He 
was  watching  Bilbo  now  from  the  distance  with  his  pale  eyes  like  telescopes. 
Bilbo could not see him, but he was wondering a lot about Bilbo, for he could see 
that he was no goblin at all. 
Gollum got  into his boat  and  shot off  from  the  island, while Bilbo was  sitting 
on  the  brink  altogether  flummoxed  and  at  the  end  of  his  way  and  his  wits. 
Suddenly up came Gollum and whispered and hissed: 
"Bless  us  and  splash  us, my  precioussss!  I  guess  it's  a  choice  feast;  at  least  a 
tasty morsel  it'd make  us,  gollum!" And when  he  said gollum he made a horrible 
swallowing  noise  in  his  throat.  That  is  how  he  got  his  name,  though  he  always 
called himself 'my precious.' 
The  hobbit  jumped  nearly  out  of  his  skin when  the  hiss  came  in  his  ears,  and 
he suddenly saw the pale eyes sticking out at him. 

####-"Who are you?" he said, thrusting his dagger in front of him. 
"What iss he, my preciouss?" whispered Gollum (who always spoke to himself 
through  never  having  anyone  else  to  speak  to). This  is what  he  had  come  to  find 
out,  for  he was  not  really  very  hungry  at  the moment, only  curious; otherwise he 
would have grabbed first and whispered afterwards. 
"I  am Mr. Bilbo Baggins.  I  have  lost  the  dwarves  and  I  have  lost  the wizard, 
and I don't know where I am; and "I don't want to know, if only I can get ,away." 
"What's  he  got  in  his  handses?"  said Gollum,  looking  at  the  sword, which  he 
did not quite like. 
"A sword, a blade which came out of Gondolin!" 
"Sssss,"  said  Gollum,  and  became  quite  polite.  "Praps  ye  sits  here  and  chats 
with  it  a  bitsy,  my  preciousss.  It  like  riddles,  praps  it  does,  does  it?"  He  was 
anxious  to  appear  friendly,  at  any  rate  for  the  moment,  and  until  he  found  out 
more  about  the  sword  and  the  hobbit, whether  he was  quite  alone  really, whether 
he  was  good  to  eat,  and  whether  Gollum  was  really  hungry.  Riddles were  all  he 
could  think  of.  Asking  them,  and  sometimes  guessing  them,  had  been  the  only 
game  he  had  ever  played  with  other  funny  creatures  sitting  in  their  holes  in  the 
long, long ago, before he lost all his friends and was driven away, alone, and crept 
down, down, into the dark under the mountains. 
"Very  well,"  said  Bilbo,  who  was  anxious  to  agree,  until  he  found  out  more 
about  the  creature, whether  he was  quite  alone, whether  he was  fierce  or  hungry, 
and whether he was a friend of the goblins. 
"You ask first," he said, because he had not had time to think of a riddle. 
So Gollum hissed: 
 

What has roots as nobody sees, 
Is taller than trees, 
Up, up it goes, 
And yet never grows?  

 
"Easy!" said Bilbo. "Mountain, I suppose." 
"Does  it  guess  easy?  It  must  have  a  competition  with  us,  my  preciouss!  If 
precious asks, and it doesn't answer, we eats it, my preciousss. If it asks us, and we 
doesn't answer, then we does what it wants, eh? We shows it the way out, yes!" 
"All  right!" said Bilbo, not daring  to disagree, and nearly bursting his brain to 
think of riddles that could save him from being eaten. 
 

Thirty white horses on a red hill, 

####-First they champ, 
Then they stamp, 
Then they stand still. 

 
That was all he could think of to ask-the idea of eating was rather on his mind. 
It was rather an old one, too, and Gollum knew the answer as well as you do. 
"Chestnuts,  chestnuts,"  he  hissed.  "Teeth!  teeth!  my  preciousss;  but  we  has 
only six!" Then he asked his second: 
 

Voiceless it cries, 
Wingless flutters, 
Toothless bites, 
Mouthless mutters. 

 
"Half  a  moment!"  cried  Bilbo,  who  was  still  thinking  uncomfortably  about 
eating.  Fortunately  he  had  once  heard  something  rather  like  this  before,  and 
getting  his  wits  back  he  thought  of  the  answer.  "Wind,  wind  of  course,"  he  said, 
and  he was  so  pleased  that  he made  up  one  on  the  spot.  "This'll  puzzle  the  nasty 
little underground creature," he thought: 
 

An eye in a blue face 
Saw an eye in a green face. 
"That eye is like to this eye"  
Said the first eye, 
"But in low place, 
Not in  high place."  

 
"Ss, ss, ss," said Gollum. He had been underground a long long time, and was 
forgetting  this  sort  of  thing.  But  just  as  Bilbo  was  beginning  to  hope  that  the 
wretch  would  not  be  able  to  answer,  Gollum  brought  up  memories  of  ages  and 
ages and ages before, when he lived with his grandmother in a hole in a bank by a 
river, "Sss, sss, my preciouss," he said. "Sun on the daisies it means, it does." 
But  these  ordinary  aboveground  everyday  sort  of  riddles  were  tiring  for  him. 
Also  they  reminded  him  of  days  when  he  had  been  less  lonely  and  sneaky  and 
nasty, and that put him out of temper. What is more they made him hungry; so this 
time he tried something a bit more difficult and more unpleasant: 
 

It cannot be seen, cannot be felt, 
Cannot be heard, cannot be smelt. 

####-It lies behind stars and under hills, 
And empty holes it fills. 
It comes first and follows after,  
Ends life, kills laughter.  

 
Unfortunately  for  Gollum  Bilbo  had  heard  that  sort  of  thing  before;  and  the 
answer  was  all  round  him  anyway.  "Dark!"  he  said  without  even  scratching  his 
head or putting on his thinking cap. 
 

A box without hinges, key, or lid, 
Yet golden treasure inside is hid, 

 
he asked  to gain  time, until he could  think of a really hard one. This he  thought a 
dreadfully  easy  chestnut,  though  he  had  not  asked  it  in  the  usual  words.  But  it 
proved a nasty poser for Gollum. He hissed to himself, and still he did not answer; 
he whispered and spluttered. 
After  some  while  Bilbo  became  impatient.  "Well,  what  is  it?"  he  said.  "The 
answer's  not  a  kettle  boiling  over,  as  you  seem  to  think  from  the  noise  you  are 
making." 
"Give us a chance; let it give us a chance, my preciouss-ss-ss." 
"Well," said Bilbo, after giving him a long chance, "what about your guess?" 
But  suddenly  Gollum  remembered  thieving  from  nests  long  ago,  and  sitting 
under  the  river bank  teaching his grandmother,  teaching his grandmother  to suck-
"Eggses!" he hissed. "Eggses it is!" Then he asked: 
 

A live without breath, 
As cold as death; 
Never thirsty, ever drinking, 
All in mail never clinking. 

 
He  also  in  his  turn  thought  this  was  a  dreadfully  easy  one,  because  he  was 
always  thinking  of  the  answer. But  he  could  not  remember  anything  better  at  the 
moment,  he was  so  flustered  by  the  egg-question. All  the  same  it was  a poser  for 
poor  Bilbo,  who  never  had  anything  to  do  with  the  water  if  he  could  help  it.  I 
imagine you know the answer, of course, or can guess it as easy as winking, since 
you  are  sitting  comfortably  at  home  and  have  not  the  danger  of  being  eaten  to 
disturb  your  thinking.  Bilbo  sat  and  cleared  his  throat  once  or  twice,  but  no 
answer came. 

####-After  a  while  Gollum  began  to  hiss  with  pleasure  to  himself:  "Is  it  nice,  my 
preciousss? Is it juicy? Is it scrumptiously crunchable?" He began to peer at Bilbo 
out of the darkness. 
"Half  a  moment,"  said  the  hobbit  shivering.  "I  gave  you  a  good  long  chance 
just now." 
"It must make  haste,  haste!"  said Gollum,  beginning  to  climb  out  of  his  boat 
on to the shore to get at Bilbo. But when he put his long webby foot in the water, a 
fish jumped out in a fright and fell on Bilbo's toes. 
"Ugh!"  he  said,  "it  is  cold  and  clammy!"-and  so  he  guessed.  "Fish!  Fish!"  he 
cried. "It is fish!" 
Gollum was  dreadfully  disappointed;  but Bilbo  asked  another  riddle  as  quick 
as ever be could, so that Gollum had to get back into his boat and think. 
 
No-legs lay on one-leg, two-legs sat near on three-legs, four-legs got some. 
 
It was not really the right time for this riddle, but Bilbo was in a hurry. Gollum 
might  have  had  some  trouble  guessing  it,  if  he  had  asked  it  at  another time. As it 
was,  talking  of  fish,  "no-legs" was not so very difficult, and after that the rest was 
easy. "Fish on a  little  table, man at  table sitting on a stool,  the cat has  the bones"-
that  of  course  is  the  answer,  and  Gollum  soon  gave  it.  Then  he  thought  the  time 
had come to ask something hard and horrible. This is what he said: 
 

This thing all things devours:  
Birds, beasts, trees, flowers;  
Gnaws iron, bites steel; 
Grinds hard stones to meal; 
Slays king, ruins town, 
And beats high mountain down. 

 
Poor  Bilbo  sat  in  the  dark  thinking  of  all  the  horrible  names  of  all  the  giants 
and ogres he had ever heard told of in tales, but not one of them had done all these 
things.  He  had  a  feeling  that  the  answer  was  quite  different  and  that  he  ought  to 
know it, but he could not think of it. He began to get frightened, and that is bad for 
thinking.  Gollum  began  to  get  out  of  his  boat.  He  flapped  into  the  water  and 
paddled  to  the  bank;  Bilbo  could  see  his  eyes  coming  towards  him.  His  tongue 
seemed  to  stick  in  his mouth; he wanted  to  shout out:  "Give me more  time! Give 
me time!" But all that came out with a sudden squeal was: 
"Time! Time!" 

####-Bilbo was saved by pure luck. For that of course was the answer.  
Gollum was  disappointed  once more;  and  now  he was  getting  angry,  and also 
tired  of  the  game.  It  had made  him  very  hungry  indeed.  This  time  he  did  not  go 
back  to  the  boat.  He  sat  down  in  the  dark  by  Bilbo.  That  made  the  hobbit  most 
dreadfully uncomfortable and scattered his wits. 
"It's  got  to  ask  uss  a  quesstion, my  preciouss, yes, yess, yesss.  Jusst one more 
quesstion to guess, yes, yess," said Gollum. 
But  Bilbo  simply  could  not  think  of  any  question  with  that  nasty  wet  cold 
thing  sitting  next  to  him,  and  pawing  and  poking  him.  He  scratched  himself,  he 
pinched himself; still he could not think of anything. 
"Ask us! ask us!" said Gollum. 
Bilbo  pinched  himself  and  slapped  himself;  he  gripped  on  his  little  sword;  he 
even felt  in his pocket with his other hand. There he found  the ring he had picked 
up in the passage and forgotten about. 
"What have I got in my pocket?" he said aloud. He was talking to himself, but 
Gollum thought it was a riddle, and he was frightfully upset. 
"Not fair! not fair!" he hissed. "It isn't fair, my precious, is it, to ask us what it's 
got in its nassty little pocketses?" 
Bilbo seeing what had happened and having nothing better  to ask stuck  to his 
question. "What have I got in my pocket?" he said louder.  
"S-s-s-s-s,"  hissed  Gollum.  "It  must  give  us  three  guesseses,  my  preciouss, 
three guesseses." 
"Very well! Guess away!" said Bilbo. 
"Handses!" said Gollum. 
"Wrong," said Bilbo, who had luckily just taken his hand 
out again. "Guess again!" 
"S-s-s-s-s,"  said Gollum more  upset  than  ever. He  thought  of  all  the  things  he 
kept  in  his  own  pockets:  fishbones,  goblins'  teeth, wet  shells,  a  bit  of  bat-wing, a 
sharp stone to sharpen his fangs on, and other nasty things. He tried to think what 
other people kept in their pockets. 
"Knife!" he said at last. 
"Wrong!" said Bilbo, who had lost his some time ago. "Last guess!" 
Now Gollum was  in  a much worse  state  than when  Bilbo  had  asked  him  the 
egg-question.  He  hissed  and  spluttered  and  rocked  himself  backwards  and 
forwards, and slapped his feet on the floor, and wriggled and squirmed; but still he 
did not dare to waste his last guess. 

####-"Come  on!"  said  Bilbo.  "I  am waiting!" He  tried  to  sound  bold  and  cheerful, 
but  he  did  not  feel  at  all  sure  how  the  game  was  going  to  end,  whether  Gollum 
guessed right or not. 
"Time's up!" he said. 
"String,  or  nothing!"  shrieked  Gollum,  which  was  not  quite  fair-working  in 
two guesses at once. 
"Both  wrong,"  cried  Bilbo  very much  relieved;  and  he  jumped  at  once  to  his 
feet,  put  his  back  to  the  nearest  wall,  and  held  out  his  little  sword.  He  knew,  of 
course,  that  the  riddle-game  was  sacred  and  of  immense  antiquity,  and  even 
wicked creatures were afraid  to cheat when  they played at  it. But he  felt he could 
not trust this slimy thing to keep any promise at a pinch. Any excuse would do for 
him to slide out of it. And after all that last question had not been a genuine riddle 
according to the ancient laws. 
But at any  rate Gollum did not at once attack him. He could  see  the  sword  in 
Bilbo's  hand.  He  sat  still,  shivering  and  whispering.  At  last  Bilbo  could  wait  no 
longer.  
"Well?" he said. "What about your  promise? I want to go. You must show me 
the way." 
"Did we say so, precious? Show the nassty little Baggins the way out, yes, yes. 
But what has  it got  in  its pocketses, eh? Not string, precious, but not nothing. Oh 
no! gollum!" 
"Never you mind," said Bilbo. "A promise is a promise." 
"Cross  it  is,  impatient,  precious,"  hissed  Gollum.  "But  it  must  wait,  yes  it 
must. We  can't  go  up  the  tunnels  so  hasty. We must  go  and  get  some  things  first, 
yes, things to help us." 
"Well,  hurry  up!"  said  Bilbo,  relieved  to  think  of  Gollum  going  away.  He 
thought he was just making an excuse and did not mean to come back. What was 
Gollum talking about? What useful thing could he keep out on the dark lake? But 
he  was  wrong.  Gollum  did  mean  to  come  back.  He  was  angry  now  and  hungry.  
And he was a miserable wicked creature, and already he had a plan. 
Not  far  away  was  his  island,  of  which  Bilbo  knew  nothing,  and  there  in  his 
hiding-place he kept a few wretched oddments, and one very beautiful thing, very 
beautiful, very wonderful. He had a ring, a golden ring, a precious ring. 
"My  birthday-present!"  he  whispered  to  himself,  as  he  had  often  done  in  the 
endless dark days. "That's what we wants now, yes; we wants it!" 

####-He  wanted  it  because  it  was  a  ring  of  power,  and  if  you  slipped  that  ring on 
your  finger,  you  were  invisible;  only  in  the  full  sunlight  could  you  be  seen,  and 
then only by your shadow, and that would be shaky and faint. 
"My  birthday-present! It came to me on my birthday, my precious," So he had 
always  said  to  himself.  But  who  knows  how Gollum  came  by  that  present,  ages 
ago  in  the old days when such rings were still at  large  in  the world? Perhaps even 
the Master who ruled them could not have said. Gollum used to wear it at first, till 
it tired him; and then he kept it in a pouch next his skin, till it galled him; and now 
usually he hid it in a hole in the rock on his island, and was always going back to 
look  at  it.  And  still  sometimes  he  put  it  on,  when  he  could  not  bear  to  be  parted 
from  it  any  longer,  or when  he was  very,  very,  hungry, and  tired of  fish. Then he 
would creep along dark passages looking for stray goblins. He might even venture 
into  places  where  the  torches  were  lit  and made  his  eyes  blink  and  smart;  for  he 
would  be  safe.  Oh  yes,  quite  safe.  No  one  would  see  him,  no  one  would  notice 
him,  till  he  had  his  fingers  on  their  throat. Only  a  few  hours  ago  he  had worn  it, 
and caught a small goblin-imp. How it squeaked! He still had a bone or two left to 
gnaw, but he wanted something softer.  
"Quite  safe,  yes,"  he  whispered  to  himself.  "It  won't  see  us,  will  it,  my 
precious? No. It won't see us, and its nassty little sword will be useless, yes quite." 
That is what was in his wicked little mind, as he slipped suddenly from Bilbo's 
side,  and  flapped  back  to  his  boat,  and  went  off  into  the  dark.  Bilbo  thought  he 
had  heard  the  last  of  him. Still  he waited  a while;  for  he  had  no  idea  how  to  find 
his way out alone. 
Suddenly  he  heard  a  screech.  It  sent  a  shiver  down  his  back.  Gollum  was 
cursing and wailing away in the gloom, not very far off by the sound of it. He was 
on his island, scrabbling here and there, searching and seeking in vain. 
"Where is it? Where iss it?" Bilbo heard him crying. "Losst it is, my precious, 
lost, lost! Curse us and crush us, my precious is lost!" 
"What's the matter?" Bilbo called. "What have you lost?" 
"It mustn't  ask  us,"  shrieked Gollum.  "Not  its  business,  no,  gollum!  It's  losst, 
gollum, gollum, gollum." 
"Well,  so  am  I,"  cried  Bilbo,  "and  I want  to  get  unlost. And  I won  the  game, 
and you promised. So come along! Come and let me out, and then go on with your 
looking!" 
Utterly  miserable  as  Gollum  sounded,  Bilbo  could  not  find  much  pity  in  his 
heart, and he had a feeling that anything Gollum wanted so much could hardly be 
something good. 

####-"Come along!" he shouted. 
"No,  not  yet,  precious!"  Gollum  answered.  "We  must  search  for  it,  it's  lost, 
gollum." 
"But you never guessed my last question, and you promised," said Bilbo. 
"Never guessed!"  said Gollum. Then  suddenly out of  the gloom came a  sharp 
hiss. "What has it got in its pocketses? Tell us that. It must tell first." 
As  far  as  Bilbo  knew,  there  was  no  particular  reason  why  he  should  not  tell. 
Gollum's mind had jumped to a guess quicker than his; naturally, for Gollum had 
brooded  for  ages  on  this  one  thing,  and  he  was  always  afraid  of  its  being  stolen. 
But Bilbo was annoyed at  the delay. After all, he had won  the game, pretty fairly, 
at a horrible risk. "Answers were to be guessed not given," he said. 
"But it wasn't a fair question," said Gollum. "Not a riddle, precious, no." 
"Oh  well,  if  it's  a  matter  of  ordinary  questions,"  Bilbo  replied,  "then  I  asked 
one first. What have you lost? Tell me that!" 
"What has it got in its pocketses?" The sound came hissing louder and sharper, 
and as he  looked  towards  it,  to his alarm  Bilbo now saw two small points of light 
peering  at  him. As  suspicion  grew  in Gollum's mind,  the  light  of  his  eyes  burned 
with a pale flame. 
"What have you lost?" Bilbo persisted. But now the light in Gollum's eyes had 
become  a  green  fire,  and  it  was  coming  swiftly  nearer.  Gollum  was  in  his  boat 
again,  paddling  wildly  back  to  the  dark  shore;  and  such  a  rage  of  loss  and 
suspicion was in his heart that no sword had any more terror for him. 
Bilbo  could  not  guess  what  had maddened  the  wretched  creature,  but  he  saw 
that all was up, and that Gollum meant to murder him at any rate. Just in time he 
turned  and  ran  blindly  back  up  the  dark  passage  down  which  he  had  come, 
keeping close to the wall and feeling it with his left hand. 
"What  has  it  got  in  its  pocketses?"  he heard  the hiss  loud behind him, and  the 
splash as Gollum leapt from his boat. 
"What have I, I wonder?" he said to himself, as he panted and stumbled along. 
He put his left hand in his pocket. The ring felt very cold as it quietly slipped on to 
his groping forefinger.  
The  hiss  was  close  behind  him.  He  turned  now  and  saw  Gollum's  eyes  like 
small  green  lamps  coming  up  the  slope.  Terrified  he  tried  to  run  faster,  but 
suddenly he struck his toes on a snag in the floor, and fell flat with his little sword 
under him. 

####-In a moment Gollum was on him. But before Bilbo could do anything, recover 
his breath, pick himself up, or wave his sword, Gollum passed by, taking no notice 
of him, cursing and whispering as he ran. 
What could it mean? Gollum could see in the dark. Bilbo could see the light of 
his  eyes  palely  shining  even  from  behind.  Painfully  he  got  up,  and  sheathed  his 
sword,  which  was  now  glowing  faintly  again,  then  very  cautiously  he  followed. 
There seemed nothing else to do. It was no good crawling back down to Gollum's 
water. Perhaps if he followed him, Gollum might lead him to some way of escape 
without meaning to. 
"Curse  it!  curse  it!  curse  it!"  hissed  Gollum.  "Curse  the  Baggins!  It's  gone! 
What has it got in its pocketses? Oh we guess, we guess, my precious. He's found 
it, yes he must have. My birthday-present." 
Bilbo  pricked  up  his  ears.  He  was  at  last  beginning  to  guess  himself.  He 
hurried  a  little,  getting  as  close  as  he  dared  behind  Gollum,  who  was  still  going 
quickly,  not  looking  back,  but  turning  his  head  from  side  to  side,  as Bilbo  could 
see from the faint glimmer on the walls. 
"My birthday-present! Curse it! How did we lose it, my precious? Yes, that's it. 
When we came  this way  last, when we  twisted  that nassty young squeaker. That's 
it. Curse it! It slipped from us, after all these ages and ages! It's gone, gollum." 
Suddenly Gollum sat down and began to weep, a whistling and gurgling sound 
horrible  to  listen  to.  Bilbo  halted  and  flattened  himself  against  the  tunnel-wall. 
After a while Gollum stopped weeping and began to talk. He seemed to be having 
an argument with himself. 
"It's  no  good  going  back  there  to  search,  no.  We  doesn't  remember  all  the 
places we've  visited. And  it's  no  use.  The  Baggins  has  got  it  in  its  pocketses;  the 
nassty noser has found it, we says." 
"We  guesses,  precious,  only  guesses.  We  can't  know  till  we  find  the  nassty 
creature and squeezes it. But it doesn't know what the present can do, does it? It'll 
just  keep  it  in  its  pocketses.  It  doesn't  know,  and  it  can't  go  far.  It's  lost  itself, the 
nassty nosey thing. It doesn't know the way out It said so." 
"It  said  so, yes; but  it's  tricksy.  It doesn't  say what  it means.  It won't  say what 
it's got in its pocketses. It knows. It knows a way in, it must know a way out, yes. 
It's off to the back-door. To the back-door, that's it." 
"The goblinses will catch it then. It can't get out that way, precious." 
"Ssss,  sss,  gollum!  Goblinses!  Yes,  but  if  it's  got  the  present,  our  precious 
present,  then  goblinses  will  get  it,  gollum!  They'll  find  it,  they'll  find  out what  it 
does. We shan't ever be safe again, never, gollum! One of  the goblinses will put  it 

####-on, and  then no one will  see him. He'll be  there but not  seen. Not even our clever 
eyeses  will  notice  him;  and  he'll  come  creepsy  and  tricksy  and  catch  us,  gollum, 
gollum!" 
"Then let's stop talking, precious, and make haste. If the Baggins has gone that 
way, we must go quick and see. Go! Not far now. Make haste!" 
With  a  spring Gollum got up  and  started  shambling off  at  a great pace. Bilbo 
hurried  after  him,  still  cautiously,  though  his  chief  fear  now  was  of  tripping  on 
another snag and falling with a noise. His head was in a whirl of hope and wonder. 
It  seemed  that  the  ring  he  had  was  a  magic  ring:  it  made  you  invisible!  He  had 
heard  of  such  things,  of  course,  in old old  tales; but  it was hard  to believe  that he 
really  had  found  one,  by  accident.  Still  there  it was: Gollum with  his  bright  eyes 
had passed him by, only a yard to one side. 
On  they  went,  Gollum  flip-flapping  ahead,  hissing  and  cursing;  Bilbo  behind 
going  as  softly  as  a  hobbit  can.  Soon  they  came  to  places  where,  as  Bilbo  had 
noticed  on  the way  down,  side-passages opened, this way and that. Gollum began 
at once to count them. 
"One  left,  yes. One  right,  yes. Two  right,  yes,  yes. Two  left,  yes,  yes." And so 
on and on. 
As  the count grew he slowed down, and he began  to get shaky and weepy; for 
he  was  leaving  the  water  further  and  further  behind,  and  he  was  getting  afraid. 
Goblins  might  be  about,  and  he  had  lost  his  ring.  At  last  he  stopped  by  a  low 
opening, on their left as they went up. 
"Seven  right,  yes.  Six  left,  yes!"  he  whispered.  "This  is  it.  This  is  the  way  to 
the back-door, yes. Here's the passage!" 
He  peered  in,  and  shrank  back.  "But  we  durstn't  go  in,  precious,  no  we 
durstn't. Goblinses down there. Lots of goblinses. We smells them. Ssss!" 
"What shall we do? Curse them and crush them! We must wait here, precious, 
wait a bit and see." 
So  they  came  to  a  dead  stop. Gollum  had  brought  Bilbo  to  the way  out  after 
all,  but  Bilbo  could  not  get  in!  There was Gollum  sitting humped up  right  in  the 
opening,  and his  eyes gleamed  cold  in his head,  as he  swayed  it  from  side  to  side 
between his knees. 
Bilbo  crept  away  from  the  wall  more  quietly  than  a  mouse;  but  Gollum 
stiffened  at  once,  and  sniffed,  and  his  eyes  went  green.  He  hissed  softly  but 
menacingly. He could not see  the hobbit, but now he was on  the alert, and he had 
other senses  that  the darkness had sharpened: hearing and smell. He seemed  to be 
crouched  right  down with  his  flat  hands  splayed  on  the  floor, and his head  thrust 

####-out, nose almost to the stone. Though he was only a black shadow in the gleam of 
his own eyes, Bilbo could see or feel that he was tense as a bowstring, gathered for 
a spring. 
Bilbo  almost  stopped  breathing,  and  went  stiff  himself. He was desperate. He 
must  get  away,  out  of  this  horrible  darkness,  while  he  had  any  strength  left.  He 
must  fight.  He  must  stab  the  foul  thing,  put  its  eyes  out,  kill  it.  It  meant  to  kill 
him.  No,  not  a  fair  fight.  He  was  invisible  now.  Gollum  had  no  sword. Gollum 
had  not  actually  threatened  to  kill  him,  or  tried  to  yet.  And  he  was  miserable, 
alone, lost. A sudden understanding, a pity mixed with horror, welled up in Bilbo's 
heart:  a  glimpse  of  endless  unmarked  days  without  light  or  hope  of  betterment, 
hard stone, cold fish, sneaking and whispering. All these thoughts passed in a flash 
of a second. He  trembled. And  then quite suddenly  in another flash, as  if  lifted by 
a new strength and resolve, he leaped. 
No great leap for a man, but a leap in the dark. Straight over Gollum's head he 
jumped,  seven  feet  forward  and  three  in  the  air;  indeed, had he known  it, he only 
just missed cracking his skull on the low arch of the passage. 
Gollum  threw  himself  backwards,  and  grabbed  as  the  hobbit  flew  over  him, 
but  too  late:  his  hands  snapped  on  thin  air,  and  Bilbo,  falling  fair  on  his  sturdy 
feet, sped off down the new tunnel. He did not turn to see what Gollum was doing. 
There was a hissing and cursing almost at his heels at  first,  then  it stopped. All at 
once  there  came  a  bloodcurdling  shriek,  filled  with  hatred  and  despair.  Gollum 
was defeated. He dared go no  further. He had  lost:  lost his prey, and  lost,  too,  the 
only thing he had ever cared for, his precious. The cry brought Bilbo's heart to his 
mouth,  but  still  he  held  on. Now  faint  as  an  echo,  but menacing,  the  voice  came 
behind: 
"Thief, thief, thief! Baggins! We hates it, we hates it, we hates it for ever!" 
Then  there was  a  silence. But  that  too  seemed menacing  to Bilbo.  "If  goblins 
are  so  near  that  he  smelt  them," he  thought, "then  they'll have heard his shrieking 
and cursing. Careful now, or this way will lead you to worse things." 
The passage was low and roughly made. It was not too difficult for the hobbit, 
except when,  in  spite of all care, he  stubbed his poor  toes again, several times, on 
nasty  jagged  stones  in  the  floor.  "A  bit  low  for  goblins,  at  least  for  the  big  ones," 
thought Bilbo,  not  knowing  that  even  the  big  ones,  the  ores  of  the mountains,  go 
along at a great speed stooping low with their hands almost on the ground. 
Soon the passage that had been sloping down began to go up again, and after a 
while  it  climbed  steeply.  That  slowed  Bilbo  down.  But  at  last  the  slope  stopped, 
the passage  turned a corner, and dipped down again, and  there, at  the bottom of a 

####-short  incline,  he  saw,  filtering  round  another  corner-a  glimpse  of  light.  Not  red 
light,  as  of  fire  or  lantern,  but  a  pale  out-of-doors  sort of  light. Then Bilbo began 
to run. 
Scuttling as fast as his legs would carry him he turned the last corner and came 
suddenly  right  into  an  open  space, where  the  light,  after  all  that  time  in  the  dark, 
seemed  dazzlingly  bright.  Really  it  was  only  a  leak  of  sunshine  in  through  a 
doorway, where a great door, a stone door, was left standing open. 
Bilbo  blinked,  and  then  suddenly  he  saw  the  goblins:  goblins  in  full  armour 
with drawn swords sitting just inside the door, and watching it with wide eyes, and 
watching the passage that led to it. They were aroused, alert, ready for anything. 
They saw him sooner than he saw them. Yes, they saw him. Whether it was .an 
accident,  or  a  last  trick  of  the  ring  before  it  took  a  new master,  it was  not  on  his 
finger. With yells of delight the goblins rushed upon him. 
A  pang  of  fear  and  loss,  like  an  echo  of  Gollum's  misery,  smote  Bilbo,  and 
forgetting even  to draw his sword he struck his hands  into his pockets. And- there 
was  the  ring  still,  in  his  left  pocket,  and  it  slipped  on  his  finger.  The  goblins 
stopped  short.  They  could  not  see  a  sign  of  him.  He  had  vanished.  They  yelled 
twice as loud as before, but not so delightedly.  
"Where is it?" they cried. 
"Go back up the passage!" some shouted. 
"This way!" some yelled. "That way!" others yelled. 
"Look out for the door," bellowed the captain. 
Whistles  blew,  armour  clashed,  swords  rattled,  goblins  cursed  and  swore  and 
ran hither and thither, falling over one another and getting very angry. There was a 
terrible outcry, to-do, and disturbance. 
Bilbo was  dreadfully  frightened,  but  he  had  the  sense  to  understand what  had 
happened and to sneak behind a big barrel which held drink for the goblin-guards, 
and  so  get  out  of  the  way  and  avoid  being  bumped  into,  trampled  to  death,  or 
caught by feel. 
"I must  get  to  the  door,  I must  get  to  the  door!"  he  kept  on  saying  to  himself, 
but  it was  a  long  time  before  he ventured  to  try. Then  it was  like a horrible game 
of  blind-man's  buff.  The  place  was  full  of  goblins  running  about,  and  the  poor 
little  hobbit  dodged  this  way  and  that,  was  knocked  over  by  a  goblin  who  could 
not  make  out  what  he  had  bumped  into,  scrambled  away  on  all  fours,  slipped 
between the legs of the captain just in time, got up, and ran for the door.  
It  was  still  ajar,  but  a  goblin  had  pushed  it  nearly  to.  Bilbo  struggled  but  he 
could  not  move  it.  He  tried  to  squeeze  through  the  crack.  He  squeezed  and 

####-squeezed, and he  stuck!  It was awful. His buttons had got wedged on  the edge of 
the  door  and  the  door-post.  He  could  see  outside  into  the  open  air:  there  were  a 
few  steps  running  down  into  a  narrow  valley  between  tall  mountains;  the  sun 
came  out  from  behind  a  cloud  and  shone  bright  on  the  outside  of  the  door-but he 
could not get through. 
Suddenly  one  of  the  goblins  inside  shouted:  "There  is  a  shadow  by  the  door. 
Something is outside!" 
Bilbo's  heart  jumped  into  his mouth. He  gave  a  terrific  squirm. Buttons burst 
off in all directions. He was through, with a torn coat and waistcoat, leaping down 
the steps  like a goat, while bewildered goblins were still picking up his nice brass 
buttons on the doorstep. 
Of course they soon came down after him, hooting and hallooing, and hunting 
among  the  trees. But  they  don't  like  the  sun:  it makes  their  legs wobble  and  their 
heads giddy. They could not find Bilbo with the ring on, slipping in and out of the 
shadow of  the  trees,  running quick and quiet, and keeping out of  the sun; so soon 
they went back grumbling and cursing to guard the door. Bilbo had escaped. 
 

####-<h4>Chapter 6 </h4> <br>

Out of the Frying-Pan into the Fire 

 
Bilbo had escaped the goblins, but he did not know where he was. He had lost 
hood,  cloak,  food,  pony,  his  buttons  and  his  friends. He wandered  on  and  on,  till 
the  sun  began  to  sink westwards-behind  the mountains. Their shadows fell across 
Bilbo's  path,  and  he  looked  back.  Then  he  looked  forward  and  could  see  before 
him  only  ridges  and  slopes  falling  towards  lowlands  and  plains  glimpsed 
occasionally between the trees. 
"Good  heavens!"  he  exclaimed.  "I  seem  to  have  got  right  to  the  other  side  of 
the Misty Mountains,  right  to  the  edge  of  the Land Beyond! Where  and O where 
can  Gandalf  and  the  dwarves  have  got  to?  I  only  hope  to  goodness  they  are  not 
still back there in the power of the goblins!" 
He  still wandered on, out of  the  little high valley, over  its edge, and down  the 
slopes beyond; but all the while a very uncomfortable thought was growing inside 
him.  He  wondered  whether  he  ought  not,  now  he  had  the magic  ring,  to  go  back 
into  the  horrible,  horrible,  tunnels  and  look  for  his  friends.  He  had  just made  up 
his  mind  that  it  was  his  duty,  that  he  must  turn  back-and  very miserable  he  felt 
about it-when he heard voices. 
He  stopped  and  listened.  It  did  not  sound  like  goblins;  so  he  crept  forward 
carefully. He was  on  a  stony  path winding  downwards with  a  rocky wall.  on  the 
left hand; on the other side the ground sloped away and there were dells below the 
level  of  the  path  overhung with  bushes  and  low  trees.  In  one  of  these  dells  under 
the bushes people were talking. 
He crept still nearer, and suddenly he saw peering between  two big boulders a 
head with a red hood on:  it was Balin doing  look-out. He could have clapped and 
shouted  for  joy,  but  he  did  not.  He  had  still  got  the  ring  on,  for  fear  of  meeting 
something unexpected and unpleasant, and he saw that Balin was looking straight 
at him without noticing him. 
"I will  give  them  all  a  surprise,"  he  thought,  as  he  crawled  into  the  bushes at 
the edge of the dell. Gandalf was arguing with the dwarves. They were discussing 
all  that  had  happened  to  them  in  the  tunnels,  and  wondering  and  debating  what 
they were  to  do  now. The  dwarves were  grumbling,  and Gandalf was  saying  that 
they could not possibly go on with their journey leaving Mr. Baggins in the hands 
of  the  goblins,  without  trying  to  find  out  if  he  was  alive  or  dead,  and  without 
trying to rescue him. 

####-"After  all  he  is  my  friend,"  said  the  wizard,  "and  not  a  bad  little  chap.  I  feel 
responsible for him. I wish to goodness you had not lost him." 
The  dwarves  wanted  to  know  why  he  had  ever  been  brought  at  all,  why  he 
could not  stick  to his  friends  and  come  along with  them,  and why  the wizard had 
not chosen someone with more sense. "He has been more trouble than use so far," 
said  one.  "If  we  have  got  to'  go  back  now  into  those  abominable  tunnels  to  look 
for him, then drat him, I say." 
Gandalf answered angrily: "I brought him, and  I don't bring  things  that are of 
no use. Either you help me to look for him, or I go and leave you here to get out of 
the mess as best you can yourselves. If we can only find him again, you will thank 
me before all is over. Whatever did you want to go and drop him for, Dori?" 
"You would  have  dropped  him,"  said Dori,  "if a goblin had suddenly grabbed 
your  leg  from  behind  in  the  dark,  tripped  up  your  feet,  and  kicked  you  in  the 
back!" 
"Then why didn't you pick him up again?" 
"Good  heavens!  Can  you  ask!  Goblins  fighting  and  biting  in  the  dark, 
everybody falling over bodies  and hitting one another! You nearly chopped off my 
head  with  Glamdring,  and  Thorin Was  stabbing  here  there  and  everywhere  with 
Orcrist.  All  of  a  sudden  you  gave  one  of  your  blinding  flashes,  and  we  saw  the 
goblins running back yelping. You shouted 'follow me everybody!' and everybody 
ought  to  have  followed. We  thought  everybody  had. There was  no  time  to  count, 
as  you  know  quite  well,  till  we  had  dashed  through  the  gate-guards,  out  of  the 
lower  door,  and  helter-skelter  down  here.  And  here  we  are-without  the  burglar, 
confusticate him!" 
"And  here's  the  burglar!"  said  Bilbo  stepping  down  into  the  middle  of  them, 
and slipping off the ring. 
Bless  me,  how  they  jumped!  Then  they  shouted  with  surprise  and  delight. 
Gandalf was as astonished as any of  them, but probably more pleased than all the 
others. He called to Balin and told him what he thought of a look-out man who let 
people  walk  right  into  them  like  that  without  warning.  It  is  a  fact  that  Bilbo's 
reputation  went  up  a  very  great  deal  with  the  dwarves  after  this.  If  they had  still 
doubted  that  he  was  really  a  first-class  burglar,  in  spite  of Gandalf's words,  they 
doubted  no  longer. Balin was  the most  puzzled  of  all;  but  everyone  said  it was  a 
very clever bit of work. 
Indeed Bilbo was  so  pleased with  their  praise  that he just chuckled inside and 
said nothing whatever about  the  ring; and when  they asked him how he did  it, he 
said: "O, just crept along, you know-very carefully and quietly." 

####-"Well,  it  is  the  first  time  that  even  a  mouse  has  crept  along  carefully  and 
quietly  under my  very  nose  and  not  been  spotted,"  said Balin,  "and  I  take  off my 
hood to you." Which he did. 
"Balin at your service," said he. 
"Your servant, Mr. Baggins," said Bilbo. 
Then  they  wanted  to  know  all  about  his  adventures  after  they  had  lost  him, 
and  he  sat  down  and  told  them  everything-except  about  the  finding  of  the  ring 
("not  just  now"  he  thought).  They  were  particularly  interested  in  the  riddle-
competition, and shuddered most appreciatively at his description of Gollum. 
"And  then  I  couldn't  think  of  any  other  question with  him  sitting  beside me," 
ended Bilbo; "so I said  'what's in my pocket?' And he couldn't guess in three goes. 
So I said: 'what about your promise? Show me the way out!' But he came at me to 
kill  me,  and  I  ran,  and  fell  over,  and  he missed me  in  the  dark.  Then  I  followed 
him,  because  I  heard  him  talking  to  himself.  He  thought  I  really  knew  the  way 
out,  and  so  he  was  making  for  it.  And  then  he  sat  down  in  the  entrance,  and  I 
could not get by. So I jumped over him and escaped, and ran down to the gate." 
"What about guards?" they asked. "Weren't there any?" 
"O yes! lots of them; but I dodged 'em. I got stuck in the door, which was only 
open a crack, and  I  lost  lots of buttons," he  said  sadly  looking at his  torn clothes. 
"But I squeezed through all right-and here I am." 
The  dwarves  looked  at  him  with  quite  a  new  respect,  when  he  talked  about 
dodging  guards,  jumping  over  Gollum,  and  squeezing  through,  as  if  it  was  not 
very difficult or very alarming. 
"What  did  I  tell  you?"  said  Gandalf  laughing.  "Mr.  Baggins  has more  about 
him than you guess." He gave Bilbo a queer look from under his bushy eyebrows, 
as he said this, and the hobbit wondered if he guessed at the part of his tale that he 
had left out. 
Then he had questions of his own to ask, for if Gandalf had explained it all by 
now  to  the  dwarves,  Bilbo  had  not  heard  it.  He  wanted  to  know  how  the  wizard 
had turned up again, and where they had all got to now.  
The wizard, to tell the truth, never minded explaining his cleverness more than 
once, so now he had told Bilbo that both he and Elrond had been well aware of the 
presence of evil goblins  in  that part of  the mountains. But  their main gate used  to 
come out on a different pass, one more easy to travel by, so that they often caught 
people  benighted  near  their  gates. Evidently  people  had  given  up  going  that way, 
and  the  goblins  must  have  opened  their  new  entrance  at  the  top  of  the  pass  the 
dwarves had taken, quite recently, because it had been found quite safe up to now.  

####-"I must see if I can't find a more or less decent giant to block it up again," said 
Gandalf, "or soon there will be no getting over the mountains at all." 
As  soon  as Gandalf  had  heard Bilbo's  yell  he  realized what  had  happened.  In 
the flash which killed the goblins that were grabbing him he had nipped inside the 
crack, just as it snapped to. He followed after the drivers and prisoners right to the 
edge  of  the  great  hall,  and  there  he  sat  down  and  worked  up  the  best  magic  he 
could in the shadows. 
"A very ticklish business, it was," he said. "Touch and go!" 
But,  of  course,  Gandalf  had  made  a  special  study  of  bewitchments  with  fire 
and  lights (even  the hobbit had never forgotten  the magic fireworks at Old Took's 
midsummer-eve  parties,  as  you  remember).  The  rest  we  all  know  -  except  that 
Gandalf knew all about  the back-door, as the goblins called the lower gate, where 
Bilbo lost his buttons. As a matter of fact it was well known to anybody who was 
acquainted with this part of the mountains; but it took a wizard to keep his head in 
the tunnels and guide them in the right direction. 
"They made  that  gate  ages  ago,"  he  said,  "partly  for  a way  of  escape,  if  they 
needed one; partly as a way out into the lands beyond, where they still come in the 
dark and do great damage. They guard  it always and no one has ever managed to 
block it up. They will guard it doubly after this," he laughed. 
All  the  others  laughed  too.  After  all  they  had  lost  a  good  deal,  but  they  had 
killed the Great Goblin and a great many others besides, and they had all escaped, 
so they might be said to have had the best of it so far.  
But  the  wizard  called  them  to  their  senses.  "We  must  be  getting  on  at  once, 
now we  are  a  little  rested,"  he  said.  "They will  be  out  after  us  in  hundreds when 
night  comes  on;  and  already  shadows  are  lengthening.  They  can  smell  our 
footsteps  for  hours  and  hours  after  we  have  passed. We  must  be  miles  on  before 
dusk. There will be a bit of moon,  if  it keeps fine, and  that  is  lucky. Not  that  they 
mind the moon much, but it will give us a little light to steer by." 
"O yes!" he said  in answer  to more questions from  the hobbit. "You  lose  track 
of  time  inside  goblin-tunnels.  Today's  Thursday,  and  it  was  Monday  night  or 
Tuesday morning that we were captured. We have gone miles and miles, and come 
right down through the heart of the mountains, and are now on the other side-quite 
a short cut. But we are not at  the point  to which our pass would have brought us; 
we  are  too  far  to  the North,  and  have  some  awkward  country  ahead. And we  are 
still pretty high up. Let's get on!" 
 

####-"I  am  so dreadfully hungry," groaned Bilbo, who was  suddenly  aware  that he 
had  not  had  a meal  since  the  night  before  the  night  before  last.  Just  think  of  that 
for  a  hobbit!  His  stomach  felt  all  empty  and  loose  and  his  legs  all  wobbly,  now 
that the excitement was over.  
"Can't  help  it,"  said Gandalf,  "unless  you  like  to  go  back  and  ask  the  goblins 
nicely to let you have your pony back and your luggage." 
"No thank you!" said Bilbo. 
"Very well  then, we must  just  tighten our belts  and  trudge on  - or  we shall be 
made into supper, and that will be much worse than having none ourselves." 
As  they went  on  Bilbo  looked  from  side  to  side  for  something  to  eat;  but  the 
blackberries were  still  only  in  flower,  and  of  course  there were  no  nuts,  nor  even 
hawthorn-berries. He nibbled a bit of sorrel, and he drank from a small mountain-
stream that crossed the path, and he ate three wild strawberries that he found on its 
bank, but it was not much good. 
They  still  went  on  and  on.  The  rough  path  disappeared.  The  bushes,  and  the 
long  grasses,  between  the  boulders,  the  patches  of  rabbit-cropped  turf,  the  thyme 
and  the  sage  and  the  marjoram,  and  the  yellow  rockroses  all  vanished,  and  they 
found themselves at the top of a wide steep slope of fallen stones, the remains of a 
landslide.  When  they  began  to  go  down  this,  rubbish  and  small  pebbles  rolled 
away  from  their  feet;  soon  larger  bits  of  split  stone  went  clattering  down  and 
started  other  pieces  below  them  slithering  and  rolling;  then  lumps  of  rocks  were 
disturbed and bounded off, crashing down with a dust and a noise. Before long the 
whole  slope  above  them  and  below  them  seemed  on  the  move,  and  they  were 
sliding  away,  huddled  all  together,  in  a  fearful  confusion  of  slipping,  rattling, 
cracking slabs and stones. 
It  was  the  trees  at  the  bottom  that  saved  them.  They  slid  into  the  edge  of  a 
climbing  wood  of  pines  that  here  stood  right  up  the  mountain  slope  from  the 
deeper  darker  forests  of  the  valleys  below.  Some  caught  hold  of  the  trunks  and 
swung  themselves  into  lower  branches,  some  (like  the  little  hobbit)  got  behind  a 
tree to shelter from the onslaught of the rocks. Soon the danger was over, the slide 
had  stopped,  and  the  last  faint  crashes  could  be  heard  as  the  largest  of  the 
disturbed  stones  went  bounding  and  spinning  among  the  bracken  and  the  pine-
roots far below.  
"Well!  that  has  got  us  on  a  bit,"  said  Gandalf;  "and  even  goblins  tracking  us 
will have a job to come down here quietly." 

####-"I  daresay,"  grumbled Bombur;  "but  they won't  find  it  difficult  to  send  stones 
bouncing  down  on  our  heads."  The  dwarves  (and  Bilbo)  were  feeling  far  from 
happy, and were rubbing their bruised and damaged legs and feet. 
"Nonsense!  We  are  going  to  turn  aside  here  out  of  the  path  of  the  slide.  We 
must  be  quick! Look  at  the  light!" The  sun  had  long  gone behind  the mountains. 
Already  the  shadows  were  deepening  about  them,  though  far  away  through  the 
trees and over  the black  tops of  those growing  lower down  they could still see  the 
evening  lights  on  the  plains  beyond. They  limped  along  now  as  fast  as  they were 
able  down  the  gentle  slopes  of  a  pine  forest  in  a  slanting  path  leading  steadily 
southwards. At  times  they were pushing  through a sea of bracken with  tall  fronds 
rising  right  above  the  hobbit's  head;  at  times  they  were  marching  along  quiet  as 
quiet  over  a  floor  of  pine-needles;  and  all  the  while  the  forest-gloom got heavier 
and  the  forest-silence deeper. There was no wind that evening to bring even a sea-
sighing into the branches of the trees. 
 
"Must we go any further?" asked Bilbo, when it was so dark that he could only 
just  see  Thorin's  beard  wagging  beside  him,  and  so  quiet  that  he  could  hear  the 
dwarves'  breathing  like  a  loud  noise.  "My  toes  are  all  bruised  and  bent,  and  my 
legs ache, and my stomach is wagging like an empty sack." 
"A bit further," said Gandalf. 
After  what  seemed  ages  further  they  came  suddenly  to  an  opening  where  no 
trees  grew.  The  moon  was  up  and  was  shining  into  the  clearing.  Somehow  it 
struck  all of  them  as not  at  all  a nice place,  although  there was nothing wrong  to 
see. 
All  of a sudden  they heard a howl away down hill, a  long shuddering howl. It 
was  answered  by  another  away  to  the  right  and  a  good  deal  nearer  to  them;  then 
by  another  not  far  away  to  the  left.  It  was  wolves  howling  at  the  moon,  wolves 
gathering together! 
There were no wolves living near Mr. Baggins' hole at home, but he knew that 
noise.  He  had  had  it  described  to  him  often  enough  in  tales.  One  of  his  elder 
cousins  (on  the  Took  side),  who  had  been  a  great  traveller,  used  to  imitate  it  to 
frighten him. To hear  it  out  in  the forest under  the moon was  too much for Bilbo. 
Even  magic  rings  are  not  much  use  against  wolves-especially  against  the  evil 
packs that lived under the shadow of the goblin-infested mountains, over the Edge 
of  the Wild  on  the  borders  of  the  unknown. Wolves of  that sort smell keener  than 
goblins, and do not need to see you to catch you! 

####-"What  shall  we  do,  what  shall  we  do!"  he  cried.  "Escaping  goblins  to  be 
caught  by wolves!"  he  said,  and  it  became  a  proverb,  though we  now  say  'out  of 
the frying-pan into the fire' in the same sort of uncomfortable situations. 
"Up the trees quick!" cried Gandalf; and they ran to the trees at the edge of the 
glade,  hunting  for  those  that  had  branches  fairly  low,  or  were  slender  enough  to 
swarm  up.  They  found  them  as  quick  as  ever  they  could,  you  can  guess;  and  up 
they went as high as ever  they could  trust  the branches. You would have  laughed 
(from a safe distance), if you had seen the dwarves sitting up in the trees with their 
beards dangling down, like old gentlemen gone cracked and playing at being boys. 
Fili and Kili were at the top of a tall larch like an enormous Christmas tree. Dori, 
Nori,  On,  Oin,  and  Gloin  were  more  comfortable  in  a  huge  pine  with  regular 
branches  sticking  out  at  intervals  like  the  spokes  of  a  wheel.  Bifur,  Bofur, 
Bombur,  and  Thorin  were  in  another.  Dwalin  and  Balin  had  swarmed  up  a  tall 
slender fir with few branches and were  trying  to find a place  to sit  in  the greenery 
of  the  topmost  boughs.  Gandalf,  who  was  a  good  deal  taller  than  the  others,  had 
found  a  tree  into  which  they  could  not  climb,  a  large  pine  standing  at  the  very 
edge  of  the  glade. He was  quite  hidden  in  its  boughs,  but  you  could  see  his  eyes 
gleaming in the moon as he peeped out. 
And Bilbo? He could not get into any tree, and was scuttling about from trunk 
to trunk, like a rabbit that has lost its hole and has a dog after it. 
"You've left the burglar behind again}" said Nori to Dori looking down. 
"I  can't  be  always  carrying  burglars  on  my  back,"  said  Dori,  "down  tunnels 
and up trees! What do you think I am? A porter?" 
"He'll be eaten if we don't 'do something," said Thorin, for there were howls all 
around  them  now,  getting  nearer  and  nearer.  "Dori!"  he  called,  for  Dori  was 
lowest down in the easiest tree, "be quick, and give Mr. Baggins a hand up!" 
Dori was really a decent fellow in spite of his grumbling. Poor Bilbo could not 
reach  his  hand  even  when  he  climbed  down  to  the  bottom  branch  and  hung  his 
arm down as far as ever he could. So Dori actually climbed out of the tree and let 
Bilbo scramble up and stand on his back. 
Just  at  that  moment  the  wolves  trotted  howling  into  the  clearing.  All  of  a 
sudden  there  were  hundreds  of  eyes  looking  at  them.  Still  Dori  did  not  let  Bilbo 
down.  He  waited  till  he  had  clambered  off  his  shoulders  into  the  branches,  and 
then he jumped for the branches himself. Only just in time! A wolf snapped- at his 
cloak as he swung up, and nearly got him. In a minute there was a whole pack of 
them yelping all round  the  tree and  leaping up at  the  trunk, with eyes blazing and 
tongues hanging out. 

####-But  even  the  wild  Wargs  (for  so  the  evil  wolves  over  the  Edge  of  the  Wild 
were named) cannot climb  trees. For a  time  they were  safe.  'Luckily  it was warm 
and not windy. Trees are not very comfortable to sit in for long at any time; but in 
the  cold  and  the wind, with wolves  all  round  below waiting  for  you,  they  can  be 
perfectly miserable places. 
This  glade  in  the  ring  of  trees  was  evidently  a  meeting-place  of  the  wolves. 
More  and  more  kept  coming  in.  They  left  guards  at  the  foot  of  the  tree  in which 
Dori  and  Bilbo  were,  and  then  went  sniffling  about  till  they  had  smelt  out  every 
tree that had anyone in it. These they guarded too, while all the rest (hundreds and 
hundreds  it  seemed) went  and  sat  in  a  great  circle  in  the  glade;  and  in the middle 
of  the circle was a great grey wolf. He  spoke  to  them  in  the dreadful  language of 
the  Wargs.  Gandalf  understood  it.  Bilbo  did  not,  but  it  sounded  terrible  to  him, 
and  as  if  all  their  talk  was  about  cruel  and  wicked  things,  as  it  was.  Every  now 
and then all the Wargs in the circle would answer their grey chief all together, and 
their dreadful clamour almost made the hobbit fall out of his pine-tree. 
I  will  tell  you  what  Gandalf  heard,  though  Bilbo  did  not  understand  it.  The 
Wargs  and  the  goblins  often  helped  one  another  in wicked  deeds. Goblins  do  not 
usually venture very  far  from  their mountains, unless  they  are driven out  and  are 
looking  for  new  homes,  or  are marching  to  war  (which  I  am  glad  to  say  has  not 
happened for a long while). But in those days they sometimes used to go on raids, 
especially to get food or slaves to work for them. Then they often got the Wargs to 
help  and  shared  the  plunder with  them. Sometimes  they  rode  on wolves  like men 
do  on  horses.  Now  it  seemed  that  a  great  goblin-raid  had  been  planned  for  that 
very  night.  The  Wargs  had  come  to  meet  the  goblins  and  the  goblins  were  late. 
The  reason,  no  doubt,  was  the  death  of  the  Great  Goblin,  and  all  the  excitement 
caused  by  the  dwarves  and  Bilbo  and  the  wizard,  for  whom  they  were  probably 
still hunting. 
In spite of  the dangers of  this  far  land bold men had of  late been making  their 
way  back  into  it  from  the  South,  cutting  down  trees,  and  building  themselves 
places to live in among the more pleasant woods in the valleys and along the river-
shores. There were many of  them, and  they were brave and well-armed, and even 
the Wargs dared not attack  them  if  there were many  together, or  in  the bright day. 
But  now  they  had  planned with  the  goblins'  help  to  come  by  night  upon  some  of 
the  villages nearest  the mountains.  If  their plan had been carried out,  there would 
have been none  left  there next day;  all would have been killed  except  the  few  the 
goblins kept from the wolves and carried back as prisoners to their caves. 

####-This was dreadful talk to listen to, not only because of the brave woodmen and 
their  wives  and  children,  but  also  because  of  the  danger  which  now  threatened 
Gandalf  and his  friends. The Wargs were  angry  and puzzled  at  finding  them here 
in  their  very meeting-place. They  thought  they were  friends of  the woodmen, and 
were  come  to  spy  on  them,  and  would  take  news  of  their  plans  down  into  the 
valleys,  and  then  the  goblins  and  the wolves would  have  to  fight  a  terrible  battle 
instead  of  capturing  prisoners  and  devouring  people  waked  suddenly  from  their 
sleep. So  the Wargs  had  no  intention  of  going  away  and  letting  the  people  up  the 
trees escape, at any rate not until morning. And long before that, they said, goblin 
soldiers would be coming down  from  the mountains; and goblins can climb  trees, 
or cut them down. 
Now you can understand why Gandalf, listening to their growling and yelping, 
began  to be dreadfully afraid, wizard  though he was, and  to feel  that  they were  in 
a very bad place, and had not yet escaped at all. All  the same he was not going to 
let them have it all their own way, though he could not do very much stuck up in a 
tall  tree  with  wolves  all  round  on  the  ground  below.  He  gathered  the  huge 
pinecones  from  the  branches  of  his  tree.  Then  he  set  one  alight  with  bright  blue 
fire, and  threw  it whizzing down among  the circle of  the wolves.  It  struck one on 
the back, and  immediately his shaggy coat caught  fire, and he was  leaping  to and 
fro  yelping  horribly.  Then  another  came  and  another,  one  in  blue  flames,  one  in 
red,  another  in  green.  They  burst  on  the  ground  in  the  middle  of  the  circle  and 
went off in coloured sparks and smoke. A specially large one hit the chief wolf on 
the  nose,  and  he  leaped  in  the  air  ten  feet,  and  then  rushed  round  and  round  the 
circle biting and snapping even at the other wolves in his anger and fright. 
The  dwarves  and  Bilbo  shouted  and  cheered.  The  rage  of  the  wolves  was 
terrible  to  see,  and  the  commotion  they  made  filled  all  the  forest.  Wolves  are  
afraid of fire at all times, but this was a most horrible and uncanny fire. If a spark 
got  in  their coats  it stuck and burned  into  them, and unless  they  rolled over quick 
they  were  soon  all  in  flames.  Very  soon  all  about  the  glade  wolves  were  rolling 
over  and over  to put out  the  sparks on  their backs, while  those  that  were burning 
were running about howling and setting others alight, till their own friends chased 
them  away  and  they  fled  off  down  the  slopes  crying  and  yammering  and  looking 
for water.  
 
"What's  all  this  uproar  in  the  forest  tonight?"  said  the  Lord  of  the  Eagles. He 
was  sitting,  black  in  the moonlight,  on  the  top  of  a  lonely  pinnacle  of  rock  at  the 

####-eastern edge of  the mountains. "I hear wolves' voices! Are  the goblins at mischief 
in the woods?" 
He swept up  into  the air, and  immediately  two of his guards  from the rocks at 
either hand  leaped up  to  follow him. They circled up  in  the sky and  looked down 
upon  the  ring  of  the Wargs,  a  tiny  spot  far  far  below.  But  eagles  have  keen  eyes 
and  can  see  small  things  at  a  great  distance.  The  lord  of  the  eagles  of  the  Misty 
Mountains had eyes  that could  look at  the  sun unblinking, and could  see a  rabbit 
moving on the ground a mile below even in the moonlight. So though he could not 
see  the  people  in  the  trees,  he  could make  out  the  commotion  among  the wolves 
and  see  the  tiny  flashes  of  fire,  and  hear  the  howling  and  yelping  come  up  faint 
from far beneath him. Also he could see the glint of the moon on goblin spears and 
helmets,  as  long  lines  of  the wicked  folk  crept  down  the  hillsides  from  their  gate 
and wound into the wood. 
Eagles are not kindly birds. Some are cowardly and cruel. But the ancient race 
of  the  northern  mountains  were  the  greatest  of  all  birds;  they  were  proud  and 
strong and noble-hearted. They did not love goblins, or fear them. When they took 
any  notice  of  them at all (which was seldom, for they did not eat such creatures ), 
they  swooped on  them and drove  them  shrieking back  to  their caves, and  stopped 
whatever  wickedness  they  were  doing.  The  goblins  hated  the  eagles  and  feared 
them, but could not reach their lofty seats, or drive them from the mountains. 
Tonight  the  Lord  of  the  Eagles  was  filled  with  curiosity  to  know  what  was 
afoot;  so  he  summoned  many  other  eagles  to  him,  and  they  flew  away  from  the 
mountains,  and  slowly  circling  ever  round  and  round  they  came  down,  down, 
down towards the ring of the wolves and the meeting-place of the goblins. 
A  very  good  thing  too!  Dreadful  things  had  been  going  on  down  there.  The 
wolves  that  had  caught  fire  and  fled  into  the  forest  had  set  it  alight  in  several 
places.  It  was  high  summer,  and  on  this  eastern  side  of  the  mountains  there  had 
been little rain for some time. Yellowing bracken, fallen branches, deep-piled pine-
needles, and here and there dead trees, were soon in flames. All round the clearing 
of  the  Wargs  fire  was  leaping.  But  the  wolf-guards  did  not  leave  the  trees. 
Maddened and angry they were leaping and howling round the trunks, and cursing 
the  dwarves  in  their  horrible  language,  with  their  tongues  hanging  out,  and  their 
eyes shining as red and fierce as the flames. 
Then  suddenly  goblins  came  running  up  yelling.  They  thought  a  battle  with 
the  woodmen  was  going  on;  but  they  goon  learned  what  had  really  happened. 
Some  of  them  actually  sat  down  and  laughed.  Others  waved  their  spears  and 

####-clashed  the  shafts  against  their  shields.  Goblins  are  not  afraid  of  fire,  and  they 
soon had a plan which seemed to them most amusing. 
Some got all the wolves together in a pack. Some stacked fern and brushwood 
round  the  tree-trunks.  Others  rushed  round  and  stamped  and  beat,  and  beat  and 
stamped,  until  nearly  all  the  flames were  put  out-but  they did not put out  the  fire 
nearest  to  the  trees  where  the  dwarves  were.  That  fire  they  fed  with  leaves  and 
dead  branches  and  bracken.  Soon  they  had  a  ring  of  smoke  and  flame  all  round 
the dwarves, a ring which they kept from spreading outwards; but it closed slowly 
in,  till  the  running  fire  was  licking  the  fuel  piled  under  the  trees.  Smoke  was  in 
Bilbo's  eyes,  he  could  feel  the  heat  of  the  flames;  and  through  the  reek  he  could 
see  the  goblins  dancing  round  and  round  in  a  circle  like  people  round  a 
midsummer  bonfire.  Outside  the  ring  of  dancing  warriors  with  spears  and  axes 
stood the wolves at a respectful distance, watching and waiting. 
He could hear the goblins beginning a horrible song: 
 

Fifteen birds in five firtrees, 
their feathers were fanned in a fiery breeze! 
But, funny little birds, they had no wings! 
O what shall we do with the funny little things?  
Roast 'em alive, or stew them in a pot; 
fry them, boil them and eat them hot?  

 
Then  they  stopped  and  shouted  out:  "Fly  away  little  birds!  Fly  away  if  you 
can! Come down little birds, or you will get roasted in your nests! Sing, sing little 
birds! Why don't you sing?" 
"Go  away!  little  boys!"  shouted Gandalf  in  answer.  "It  isn't  bird-nesting time. 
Also naughty little boys that play with fire get punished." He said it to make them 
angry,  and  to  show  them  he was  not  frightened  of  them-though of course he was, 
wizard though he was. But they took no notice, and they went on singing. 
 

Burn, burn tree and fern! 
Shrivel and scorch! A fizzling torch 
To light the night for our delight, 
Ya hey! 
 
Bake and toast 'em, fry and roast 'em 
till beards blaze, and eyes glaze; 
till hair smells and skins crack, 
fat melts, and bones black 

####-in cinders lie 
beneath the sky! 
 
So dwarves shall die, 
and light the night for our delight, 
Ya hey! 
Ya-harri-heyl 
Ya hoy! 

 
And  with  that  Ya  hoy!  the  flames  were  under  Gandalf’s  tree.  In  a moment  it 
spread to the others. The bark caught fire, the lower branches cracked. 
Then  Gandalf  climbed  to  the  top  of  his  tree.  The  sudden  splendour  flashed 
from  his  wand  like  lightning,  as  he  got  ready  to  spring  down  from  on  high  right 
among  the spears of  the goblins. That would have been  the end of him,  though he 
would  probably  have  killed  many  of  them  as  he  came  hurtling  down  like  a 
thunderbolt. But he never leaped. 
Just at that moment the Lord of the Eagles swept down from above, seized him 
in his talons, and was gone. 
 
There was a howl of anger and surprise from the goblins. Loud cried the Lord 
of  the Eagles,  to whom Gandalf had now  spoken. Back  swept  the great birds  that 
were  with  him,  and  down  they  came  like  huge  black  shadows.  The  wolves 
yammered and gnashed  their  teeth;  the goblins yelled and stamped with  rage, and 
flung their heavy spears in the air in vain. Over them swooped the eagles; the dark 
rush of  their beating wings  smote  them  to  the  floor or drove  them  far  away;  their 
talons  tore  at  goblin  faces.  Other  birds  flew  to  the  tree-tops  and  seized  the 
dwarves, who were scrambling up now as far as ever they dared to go. 
Poor  little Bilbo was  very  nearly  left  behind  again! He  just managed  to  catch 
hold of Dori's legs, as Dori was borne off last of all; and they went together above 
the  tumult  and  the  burning,  Bilbo  swinging  in  the  air  with  his  arms  nearly 
breaking. 
Now  far below  the goblins and  the wolves were  scattering  far and wide  in  the 
woods. A few eagles were still circling and sweeping above the battle-ground. The 
flames about  the  trees sprang suddenly up above  the highest branches. They went 
up  in  crackling  fire.  There  was  a  sudden  flurry  of  sparks  and  smoke.  Bilbo  had 
escaped only just in time! 
Soon the light of the burning was faint below, a red twinkle on the black floor; 
and  they  were  high  up  in  the  sky,  rising  all  the  time  in  strong  sweeping circles. 

####-Bilbo  never  forgot  that  flight,  clinging  onto Dori's  ankles. He moaned  "my  arms, 
my arms!"; but Dori groaned "my poor legs, my poor legs!" 
At  the  best  of  times  heights  made  Bilbo  giddy.  He  used  to  turn  queer  if  he 
looked over the edge of quite a little cliff; and he had never liked ladders, let alone 
trees  (never  having  had  to  escape  from wolves  before).  So  you  can  imagine  how 
his head swam now, when he  looked down between his dangling  toes and saw  the 
dark  lands opening wide underneath him,  touched here and there with the light of 
the moon on a hill-side rock or a stream in the plains. 
The  pale  peaks  of  the mountains were  coming  nearer, moonlit  spikes  of  rock 
sticking  out  of  black  shadows.  Summer  or  not,  it  seemed  very  cold.  He  shut  his 
eyes  and wondered if he could hold on any longer. Then he imagined what would 
happen  if he did not. He  felt  sick. The  flight  ended only  just  in  time  for him,  just 
before  his  arms  gave  way.  He  loosed  Dori's  ankles  with  a  gasp  and  fell  onto  the 
rough  platform  of  an  eagle's  eyrie.  There  he  lay  without  speaking,  and  his 
thoughts were  a mixture  of  surprise  at  being  saved  from  the  fire,  and  fear  lest  he 
fell off that narrow place into the deep shadows on either side. He was feeling very 
queer indeed in his head by this time after the dreadful adventures of the last three 
days with next to nothing to eat, and he found himself saying aloud: "Now I know 
what a piece of bacon feels like when it is suddenly picked out of the pan on a fork 
and put back on the shelf!" 
"No  you  don't!"  be  heard  Dori  answering,  "because  the  bacon  knows  that  it 
will get back in the pan sooner or later; and it is to be hoped we shan't. Also eagles 
aren't forks!" 
"O  no!  Not  a  bit  like  storks-forks,  I mean,"  said Bilbo  sitting up  and  looking 
anxiously  at  the  eagle  who  was  perched  close  by.  He  wondered  what  other 
nonsense he had been  saying, and  if  the eagle would  think  it  rude. You ought not 
to  be  rude  to  an  eagle, when  you  are  only  the  size  of  a  hobbit,  and  are  up  in  his 
eyrie at night! 
The  eagle  only  sharpened  his  beak  on  a  stone  and  trimmed  his  feathers  and 
took no notice. 
Soon  another  eagle  flew  up.  "The  Lord  of  the  Eagles  bids  you  to  bring  your 
prisoners to the Great Shelf," he cried and was off again. The other seized Dori in 
his  claws  and  flew  away  with  him  into  the  night  leaving Bilbo  all  alone. He  had 
just strength  to wonder what  the messenger had meant by  'prisoners,' and  to begin 
to  think  of  being  torn  up  for  supper  like  a  rabbit,  when  his  own  turn  came.  The 
eagle came back, seized him in his talons by the back of his coat, and swooped off. 
This  time  he  flew  only  a  short  way.  Very  soon  Bilbo  was  laid  down,  trembling 

####-with  fear,  on  a wide  shelf  of  rock  on  the mountain-side. There was no path down 
on to it save by flying; and no path down off it except by jumping over a precipice. 
There  he  found  all  the  others  sitting  with  their  backs  to  the  mountain  wall.  The 
Lord of the Eagles also was there and was speaking to Gandalf. 
It  seemed  that  Bilbo  was  not  going  to  be  eaten  after  all.  The  wizard  and  the 
eagle-lord  appeared  to  know  one  another  slightly,  and  even  to  be  on  friendly 
terms. As a matter of fact Gandalf, who had often been in the mountains, had once 
rendered  a  service  to  the  eagles  and  healed  their  lord  from  an  arrow-wound. So 
you  see  'prisoners'  had  meant  'prisoners  rescued  from  the  goblins'  only,  and  not 
captives  of  the  eagles. As Bilbo  listened  to  the  talk  of Gandalf  he  realized  that  at 
last  they  were  going  to  escape  really  and  truly  from  the  dreadful  mountains.  He 
was  discussing  plans  with  the  Great  Eagle  for  carrying  the  dwarves  and  himself 
and Bilbo far away and setting  them down well on  their  journey across  the plains 
below.  
The Lord of  the Eagles would not  take  them anywhere near where men  lived. 
"They  would  shoot  at  us  with  their  great  bows  of yew," he  said,  "for  they would 
think  we  were  after  their  sheep.  And  at  other  times  they  would  be  right.  No!  we 
are  glad  to  cheat  the  goblins  of  their  sport,  and  glad  to  repay  our  thanks  to  you, 
but we will not risk ourselves for dwarves in the southward plains." 
"Very  well,"  said  Gandalf.  "Take  us  where  and  as  far  as  you  will!  We  are 
already deeply obliged to you. But in the meantime we are famished with hunger." 
"I am nearly dead of it," said Bilbo in a weak little voice that nobody heard. 
"That can perhaps be mended," said the Lord of the Eagles. 
Later on you might have seen a bright fire on  the shelf of rock and  the figures 
of the dwarves round it cooking and making a fine roasting smell. The eagles had 
brought  up  dry  boughs  for  fuel,  and  they  had  brought  rabbits, hares, and a  small 
sheep.  The  dwarves  managed  all  the  preparations.  Bilbo  was  too  weak  to  help, 
and  anyway  he was  not much  good  at  skinning  rabbits  or  cutting  up meat,  being 
used  to  having  it  delivered  by  the  butcher  all  ready  to  cook.  Gandalf,  too,  was 
lying  down  after  doing  his  part  in  setting  the  fire  going,  since Oin  and Gloin  had 
lost their tinder-boxes. (Dwarves have never taken to matches even yet.) 
So  ended  the  adventures  of  the  Misty  Mountains.  Soon  Bilbo's  stomach  was 
feeling full and  comfortable  again,  and he  felt he  could  sleep  contentedly,  though 
really  he  would  have  liked  a  loaf  and  butter  better  than  bits  of  meat  toasted  on 
sticks. He slept curled up on the hard rock more soundly than ever he had done on 
his feather-bed in his own  little hole at home. But all night he dreamed of his own 

####-house and wandered in his sleep into all his different rooms looking for something 
that he could not find nor remember what it looked like. 
 

####-<h4>Chapter 7 </h4> <br>

Queer Lodgings 

 
The next morning Bilbo woke up with the early sun in his eyes. He jumped up 
to  look  at  the  time  and  to  go  and  put  his  kettle  on-and  found he was not home at 
all.  So  he  sat  down  and  wished  in  vain  for  a  wash  and  a  brush.  He  did  not  get 
either,  nor  tea  nor  toast  nor  bacon  for  his  breakfast, only cold mutton and  rabbit. 
And after that he had to get ready for a fresh start. 
This time he was allowed to climb on to an eagle's back and cling between his 
wings.  The  air  rushed  over  him  and  he  shut  his  eyes.  The  dwarves  were  crying 
farewells  and  promising  to  repay  the  lord  of  the  eagles  if  ever  they  could,  as  off 
rose  fifteen  great  birds  from  the  mountain's  side.  The  sun  was  still  close  to  the 
eastern  edge  of  things.  The morning was  cool,  and mists were  in  the  valleys  and 
hollows  and  twined  here  and  there  about  the  peaks  and  pinnacles  of  the  hills. 
Bilbo opened  an  eye  to peep  and  saw  that  the birds were  already high up  and  the 
world  was  far  away,  and  the  mountains  were  falling  back  behind  them  into  the 
distance. He shut his eyes again and held on tighter.  
"Don't pinch!" said his eagle. "You need not be frightened like a rabbit, even if 
you  look  rather  like  one.  It  is  a  fair morning  with  little  wind. What  is  finer  than 
flying?" 
Bilbo  would  have  liked  to  say:  "A  warm  bath  and  late  breakfast  on  the  lawn 
afterwards;"  but  he  thought  it  better  to  say  nothing  at  all,  and  to  let  go  his  clutch 
just a tiny bit. 
After  a good while  the  eagles must have  seen  the point  they were making  for, 
'even  from  their  great  height,  for  they  began  to  go  down  circling  round  in  great 
spirals. They did this for a long while, and at last the hobbit opened his eyes again. 
The earth was much nearer, and below  them were  trees  that  looked  like oaks and 
elms, and wide grass lands, and a river running through it all. But cropping out of 
the ground, right in the path of the stream which looped itself about it, was a great 
rock, almost a hill of stone,  like a  last outpost of  the distant mountains, or a huge 
piece cast miles into the plain by some giant among giants. 
Quickly  now  to  the  top  of  this  rock  the  eagles  swooped  one  by  one  and  set 
down their passengers. 
"Farewell!"  they  cried,  "wherever  you  fare,  till  your  eyries  receive  you  at  the 
journey's end!" That is the polite thing to say among eagles. 

####-"May  the  wind  under  your  wings  bear  you  where  the  sun  sails  and  the moon 
walks," answered Gandalf, who knew the correct reply.  
And so they parted. And though the lord of the eagles became in after days the 
King  of  All  Birds  and  wore  a  golden  crown,  and  his  fifteen  chieftains  golden 
collars  (made  of  the  gold  that  the  dwarves  gave  them),  Bilbo  never  saw  them 
again-except high and  far off  in  the battle of Five Armies. But as  that comes  in at 
the end of this tale we will say no more about it just now.  
There was a flat space on the top of the hill of stone and a well worn path with 
many steps leading down it to the river, across which a ford of huge flat stones led 
to  the  grass-land  beyond  the  stream.  There  was  a  little  cave  (a  wholesome  one 
with a pebbly floor) at the foot of the steps and near the end of the stony ford. Here 
the party gathered and discussed what was to be done. 
"I  always meant  to  see you  all  safe  (if possible) over  the mountains,"  said  the 
wizard,  "and  now  by  good management  and  good  luck  I  have  done  it.  Indeed we 
are  now  a  good  deal  further east than I ever meant to come with you, for after all 
this  is not my adventure.  I may  look  in on  it again before  it  is all over, but  in  the 
meanwhile I have some other pressing business to attend to." 
The  dwarves  groaned  and  looked  most  distressed,  and  Bilbo wept.  They  had 
begun to think Gandalf was going in come all the way and would always be there 
to  help  them  out  of  difficulties.  "I  am  not  going  to  disappear  this  very  instant," 
said  he.  "I  can  give  you  a  day  or  two more.  Probably  I  can  help  you  out of your 
present  plight,  and  I  need  a  little  help myself. We  have  no  food,  and  no  baggage, 
and no ponies to ride; and you don't know where you are. Now I can tell you that. 
You are still some miles north of the path which we should have been following, if 
we  had  not  left  the mountain  pass  in  a  hurry.  Very  few people  live  in  these parts, 
unless  they  have  come  here  since  I was  last  down  this way, which  is  some  years 
ago.  But  there  is  somebody  that  I  know  of,  who  lives  not  far  away.  That 
Somebody made the 
steps on the great rock-the Carrock I believe he calls it. He does not come here 
often,  certainly  not  in  the  daytime,  and  it  is  no  good  waiting  for  him.  In  fact  it 
would  be  very  dangerous. We  must  go  and  find  him;  and  if  all  goes  well  at  our 
meeting,  I  think I shall be off and wish you like the eagles  'farewell wherever you 
fare!' " 
They  begged  him  not  to  leave  them. They  offered  him  dragon-gold and silver 
and jewels, but he would not change his mind. 
"We  shall  see, we  shall  see!" he  said,  "and  I  think  I have earned already some 
of your dragon-gold - when you have got it." 

####- 
After that they stopped pleading. Then they took off their clothes and bathed in 
the river, which was shallow and clear and stony at the ford. When they had dried 
in the sun, which was now strong and warm, they were refreshed, if still sore and a 
little  hungry.  Soon  they  crossed  the  ford  (carrying  the  hobbit),  and  then  began  to 
march  through  the  long  green  grass  and  down  the  lines  of  the  wide-armed oaks 
and the tall elms. 
"And  why  is  it  called  the  Carrock?"  asked  Bilbo  as  he  went  along  at  the 
wizard's side. 
"He  called  it  the  Carrock,  because  carrock  is  his  word  for  it.  He  calls  things 
like  that  carrocks,  and  this  one  is  the Carrock  because  it  is  the  only  one  near  his 
home and he knows it well." 
"Who calls it? Who knows it?" 
"The  Somebody  I  spoke  of-a  very  great  person.  You  must  all  be  very  polite 
when  I  introduce  you.  I  shall  introduce  you  slowly,  two  by  two,  I  think;  and  you 
must  be  careful  not  to  annoy  him,  or  heaven  knows what will  happen. He can be 
appalling  when  he  is  angry,  though  he  is  kind  enough  if  humoured.  Still  I  warn 
you he gets angry easily." 
The dwarves all gathered round when they heard the wizard talking like this to 
Bilbo.  "Is  that  the  person  you  are  taking  us  to  now?"  they  asked.  "Couldn't  you 
find someone more easy-tempered? Hadn't you better explain it all a bit clearer?"-
and so on. 
"Yes  it  certainly  is!  No  I  could  not!  And  I  was  explaining  very  carefully," 
answered  the  wizard  crossly.  "If  you  must  know  more,  his  name  is  Beorn. He  is 
very strong, and he is a skin-changer." 
"What!  a  furrier,  a  man  that  calls  rabbits  conies,  when  he  doesn't  turn  their 
skins into squirrels?" asked Bilbo. 
"Good gracious heavens, no, no, NO, NO!" said Gandalf. "Don't be a fool Mr. 
Baggins  if you  can help  it; and  in  the name of all wonder don't mention  the word 
furrier  again  as  long  as  you  are  within  a  hundred  miles  of  his  house,  nor,  rug, 
cape,  tippet, muff, nor any other such unfortunate word! He  is a skin-changer. He 
changes  his  skin;  sometimes  he  is  a  huge  black  bear,  sometimes  he  is  a  great 
strong black-haired man with huge arms and a great beard. I cannot tell you much 
more,  though  that ought  to be enough. Some say  that he  is a bear descended from 
the  great  and  ancient  bears  of  the  mountains  that  lived  there  before  the  giants 
came. Others  say  that he  is  a man descended  from  the  first men who  lived before 
Smaug  or  the  other  dragons  came  into  this  part  of  the  world,  and  before  the 

####-goblins came into the hills out of the North. I cannot say, though I fancy the last is 
the true tale. He is not the sort of person to ask questions of. 
"At any rate he is under no enchantment but his own. He lives in an oak-wood 
and has a great wooden house; and as a man he keeps cattle and horses which are 
nearly  is marvellous  as himself. They work  for him  and  talk  to him. He does not 
eat  them;  neither  does  he  hunt  or  eat  wild  animals.  He  keeps  hives  and  hives  of 
great fierce bees, and  lives most on cream and honey. As a bear he ranges far and 
wide.  I  once  saw  him  sitting all alone on the top of the Carrock at night watching 
the  moon  sinking  towards  the  Misty  Mountains,  and  I  heard  him  growl  in  the 
tongue  of  bears;  'The  day  will  come  when  they  will  perish  and  I  shall  go  back!' 
That is why I believe he once came from the mountains himself." 
 
Bilbo and the dwarves had now plenty to think about, and they asked no more 
questions. They still had a long way to walk before them. Up slope and down dale 
they  plodded.  It  grew  very  hot.  Sometimes  they  rested  under  the  trees,  and  then 
Bilbo felt so hungry that he would have eaten acorns, if any had been ripe enough 
yet to have fallen to the ground. 
It  was  the  middle  of  the  afternoon  before  they  noticed  that  great  patches  of 
flowers had begun to spring up, all the same kinds growing together as if they had 
been  planted.  Especially  there  was  clover,  waving  patches  of  cockscomb  clover, 
and  purple  clover,  and wide  stretches  of  short white  sweet  honey-smelling clover. 
There  was  a  buzzing  and  a  whirring  and  a  droning  in  the  air.  Bees  were  busy 
everywhere. And such bees! Bilbo had never seen anything like them. 
"If one was to sting me," he thought, "I should swell up as big again as I am!" 
They  were  bigger  than  hornets.  The  drones  were  bigger  than  your  thumb,  a 
good  deal,  and  the  bands  of  yellow  on  their  deep  black  bodies  shone  like  fiery 
gold. 
"We are getting near," said Gandalf. "We are on the edge of his bee-pastures." 
After  a  while  they  came  to  a  belt  of  tall  and  very  ancient  oaks,  and  beyond 
these to a high thorn-hedge through which you could neither see nor scramble. 
"You had better wait here," said the wizard to the dwarves; "and when I call or 
whistle  begin  to  come  after  me —  you  will  see  the  way  I  go-but  only  in  pairs, 
mind, about  five minutes between each pair of you. Bombur  is  fattest  and will do 
for two, he had better come alone and last. Come on Mr. Baggins! There is a gate 
somewhere round this way." And with that he went off along the hedge taking the 
frightened hobbit with him. 

####-They  soon  came  to  a wooden  gate,  high  and  broad,  beyond which  they could 
see  gardens  and  a  cluster  of  low  wooden  buildings,  some  thatched  and  made  of 
unshaped logs; barns, stables, sheds, and a long low wooden house. 
Inside  on  the  southward  side  of  the  great  hedge were  rows  and  rows  of  hives 
with  bell-shaped  tops made of  straw. The noise of  the giant bees  flying  to and  fro 
and crawling in and out filled all the air.  
The  wizard  and  the  hobbit  pushed  open  the  heavy  creaking  gate  and  went 
down a wide track towards the house. Some horses, very sleek and well-groomed, 
trotted up across  the grass and  looked at  them  intently with very  intelligent  faces; 
then off they galloped to the buildings. 
"They have gone to tell him of the arrival of strangers," said Gandalf. 
Soon  they  reached  a  courtyard,  three  walls  of  which  were  formed  by  the 
wooden  house  and  its  two  long wings.  In  the middle  there was  lying  a  great  oak-
trunk with many  lopped branches beside  it. Standing near was a huge man with a 
thick black beard and' hair, and great bare arms and legs with knotted muscles. He 
was clothed in a tunic of wool down to his knees, and was leaning on a large axe. 
The horses were standing by him with their noses at his shoulder.  
"Ugh!  here  they  are!"  he  said  to  the  horses.  "They  don't  look  dangerous. You 
can be off!" He laughed a great rolling laugh, put down his axe and came forward. 
"Who  are  you  and what  do  you want?"  he  asked  gruffly,  standing  in  front  of 
them and towering tall above Gandalf. 
As for Bilbo he could easily have  trotted  through his  legs without ducking his 
head to miss the fringe of the man's brown tunic. 
"I am Gandalf," said the wizard. 
"Never  heard  of  him,"  growled  the  man,  "And  what's  this  little  fellow?"  he 
said, stooping down to frown at the hobbit with his bushy eyebrows. 
"That is Mr. Baggins, a hobbit of good family and unimpeachable reputation," 
said Gandalf. Bilbo bowed. He had no hat to take off, and was painfully conscious 
of his many missing buttons. "I am a wizard," continued Gandalf. "I have heard of 
you,  if you have not heard of me; but perhaps you have heard of my good cousin 
Radagast who lives near the Southern borders of Mirkwood?" 
"Yes;  not  a  bad  fellow  as  wizards  go,  I  believe.  I  used  to  see  him  now  and 
again,"  said  Beorn.  "Well,  now  I  know  who  you  are,  or  who  you  say  you  are. 
What do you want?" 
"To  tell  you  the  truth, we  have  lost  our  luggage  and  nearly  lost  our way,  and 
are  rather  in need of help, or  at  least  advice.  I may  say we have had  rather  a bad 
time with goblins in the mountains." 

####-"Goblins?" said the big man less gruffly. "O ho, so you've been  having trouble 
with them have you? What did you go near them for?" 
"We  did  not  mean  to.  They  surprised  us  at  night  in  a  pass  which  we  had  to 
cross, we were coming out of the Lands over West into these countries-it is a long 
tale." 
"Then  you  had  better  come  inside  and  tell  me  some  of  it,  if  it  won't  take  all 
day,"  said  the  man  leading  the  way  through  a  dark  door  that  opened  out  of  the 
courtyard into the house. 
Following  him  they  found  themselves  in  a  wide  hall  with  a  fire-place  in  the 
middle. Though  it was summer there was a wood-fire burning and the smoke was 
rising  to  the blackened  rafters  in  search of  the way out  through  an opening  in  the 
roof. They passed  through  this dim hall,  lit only by  the  fire and  the hole above  it, 
and came  through another smaller door into a sort of veranda propped on wooden 
posts made  of  single  tree-trunks. It faced south and was still warm and filled with 
the  light  of  the westering  sun which  slanted  into  it,  and  fell  golden  on  the  garden 
full of flowers that came right up to the steps. 
Here  they  sat  on  wooden  benches  while  Gandalf  began  his  tale,  and  Bilbo 
swung his dangling  legs and  looked at  the  flowers  in  the garden, wondering what 
their names could be, as he had never seen half of them before. 
"I was coming over the mountains with a friend or two…" said the wizard. 
"Or two? I can only see one, and a little one at that," said Beorn. 
"Well  to  tell you  the  truth,  I did not  like  to bother you with a  lot of us, until  I 
found out if you were busy. I will give a call, if I may." 
"Go on, call away!" 
So  Gandalf  gave  a  long  shrill  whistle,  and  presently  Thorin  and  Dori  came 
round the house by the garden path and stood bowing low before them. 
"One or three you meant, I see!" said Beorn. "But these aren't hobbits, they are 
dwarves!" 
"Thorin  Oakenshield,  at  your  service!  Dori  at  your  service!"  said  the  two 
dwarves bowing again. 
"I  don't  need  your  service,  thank  you,"  said  Beorn,  "but  I  expect  you  need 
mine.  I  am  not  over  fond  of  dwarves;  but  if  it  is  true  you  are  Thorin  (son  of 
Thrain, son of  Thror,  I believe), and  that your companion  is  respectable, and  that 
you  are  enemies  of  goblins  and  are  not  up  to  any  mischief  in  my  lands-what are 
you up to, by the way?" 
"They  are  on  their  way  to  visit  the  land  of  their  fathers,  away  east  beyond 
Mirkwood,"  put  in  Gandalf,  "and  it  is  entirely  an  accident  that  we  are  in  your 

####-lands at all. We were crossing by the High Pass that should have brought us to the 
road  that  lies  to  the  south  of  your  country,  when  we  were  attacked  by  the  evil 
goblins-as I was about to tell you." 
"Go on telling, then!" said Beorn, who was never very polite. 
"There was a terrible storm; the stone-giants were out hurling rocks, and at the 
head  of  the  pass  we  took  refuge  in  a  cave,  the  hob  bit  and  I  and  several  of  our 
companions…" 
"Do you call two several?" 
"Well, no. As a matter of fact there were more than two." 
"Where are they? Killed, eaten, gone home?" 
"Well,  no.  They  don't  seem  all  to  have  come  when  I  whistled.  Shy,  I  expect. 
You see, we are very much afraid that we are rather a lot for you to entertain." 
"Go on, whistle again! I am in for a party, it seems, and one or two more won't 
make much difference," growled Beorn. 
Gandalf  whistled  again;  but  Nori  and  Ori  were  there  almost  before  he  had 
stopped,  for,  if  you  remember, Gandalf  had  told  them  to  come  in pairs  every  five 
minutes. 
"Hullo!"  said  Beorn.  "You  came  pretty  quick-where were  you  hiding? Come 
on my jack-in-the-boxes!" 
"Nori at your service, Ori at . . ." they began; but Beorn interrupted them. 
"Thank you! When I want your help I will ask for it. Sit down, and let's get on 
with this tale, or it will be supper-time before it is ended." 
"As soon as we were asleep," went on Gandalf, "a crack at the back of the cave 
opened;  goblins  came  out  and  grabbed  the  hobbit  and  the  dwarves  and our  troop 
of ponies—" 
"Troop  of  ponies?  What  were  you-a  travelling  circus? Or were  you  carrying 
lots of goods? Or do you always call six a troop?" 
"O  no!  As  a  matter  of  fact  there  were  more  than  six  ponies,  for  there  were 
more  than  six  of  us-and well,  here  are  two more!"  Just  at  that moment Balin  and 
Dwalin appeared and bowed so low that their beards swept the stone floor. The big 
man was frowning at first, but  they did  their very best  to be frightfully polite, and 
kept  on  nodding  and  bending  and  bowing  and  waving  their  hoods  before  their 
knees  (in  proper  dwarf-fashion),  till  he  stopped  frowning  and  burst  into  a 
chuckling laugh; they looked so comical. 
"Troop, was  right,"  he  said.  "A  fine  comic  one.  Come  in my merry men,  and 
what  are  your  names?  I  don't  want  your  service  just  now,  only  your  names;  and 
then sit down and stop wagging!" 

####-"Balin  and  Dwalin,"  they  said  not  daring  to  be  offended,  and  sat  flop  on  the 
floor looking rather surprised. 
"Now go on again!" said Beorn to the wizard. 
"Where  was  1?  O  yes—  I  was  not  grabbed.  I  killed  a  goblin  or  two  with  a 
flash—" 
"Good!" growled Beorn. "It is some good being a wizard, then." 
"—and slipped inside the crack before it closed. I followed down into the main 
hall, which was  crowded with  goblins. The Great Goblin was  there with  thirty or 
forty armed guards. I thought to myself 'even if they were not all chained together, 
what can a dozen do against so many?' " 
"A  dozen!  That's  the  first  time  I've  heard  eight  called  a  dozen.  Or  have  you 
still got some more jacks that haven't yet come out of their boxes?" 
"Well, yes, there seem to be a couple more here now – Fili and Kili, I believe," 
said Gandalf, as these two now appeared and stood smiling and bowing. 
"That's enough!" said Beorn. "Sit down and be quiet! Now go on, Gandalf!" 
So  Gandalf  went  on  with  the  tale,  until  he  came  to  the  fight  in  the  dark,  the 
discovery  of  the  lower  gate,  and  their  horror  when  they  found  that  Mr.  Baggins 
had been mislaid. 
"We  counted  ourselves  and  found  that  there  was  no  hobbit.  There  were  only 
fourteen of us left!" 
"Fourteen!  That's  the  first  time  I've  heard  one  from  ten  leave  fourteen.  You 
mean nine, or else you haven't told me yet all the names of your party." 
"Well, of course you haven't seen Oin and Gloin yet. And, bless me! here they 
are. I hope you will forgive them for bothering you." 
"O  let  'em all come! Hurry up! Come along, you  two, and sit down! But  look 
here, Gandalf, even now we have only got yourself and ten dwarves and the hobbit 
that was  lost. That  only makes  eleven  (plus  one mislaid) and not fourteen, unless 
wizards  count  differently  to  other  people.  But  now  please  get  on  with  the  tale." 
Beorn did not show it more than he could help, but really he had begun to get very 
interested. You  see,  in  the  old  days  he  had  known  the  very  part of  the mountains 
that  Gandalf  was  describing.  He  nodded  and  he  growled,  when  he  heard  of  the 
hobbit's  reappearance  and  of  their  scramble  down  the  stone-slide  and  of  the wolf-
ring m the woods. When Gandalf came to their climbing into trees with the wolves 
all underneath, he got up and strode about and muttered: 
"I wish I had been there! I would have given them more than fireworks!" 
"Well,"  said  Gandalf  very  glad  to  see  that  his  tale  was  making  a  good 
impression,  "I  did  the  best  I  could.  There  we  were  with  the  wolves  going  mad 

####-underneath us  and  the  forest beginning  to blaze  in places, when  the goblins  came 
down  from  the  hills  and  discovered  us.  They  yelled  with  delight  and  sang  songs 
making fun of us. Fifteen birds in five fir-trees…" 
"Good heavens!" growled Beorn. "Don't pretend that goblins can't count. They 
can. Twelve isn't fifteen and they know it." 
"And  so  do  1.  There  were  Bifur  and  Bofur  as  well.  I  haven't  ventured  to 
introduce them before, but here they are." 
In  came  Bifur  and  Bofur.  "And  me!"  gasped  Bombur  pulling  up  behind.  He 
was  fat, and also angry at being  left  till  last. He  refused  to wait  five minutes, and 
followed immediately after the other two. 
"Well, now there are fifteen of you; and since goblins can count, I suppose that 
is  all  that  there  were  up  the  trees.  Now  perhaps  we  can  finish  this  story  without 
any more interruptions." Mr. Baggins saw then how clever Gandalf had been. The 
interruptions had really made Beorn more interested in the story, and the story had 
kept  him  from  sending  the  dwarves off  at once  like  suspicious beggars. He never 
invited people into his house, if he could help it. He had very few friends and they 
lived  a  good  way  away;  and  he  never  invited  more  than  a  couple  of  these  to  his 
house at a time. Now he had got fifteen strangers sitting in his porch! 
By  the  time  the wizard had  finished his  tale  and had  told of  the  eagles'  rescue 
and of how they had all been brought to the Carrock, the sun had fallen behind the 
peaks of the Misty Mountains and the shadows were long in Beorn's garden. 
"A  very  good  tale!"  said  he.  "The  best  I  have  heard  for  a  long  while.  If  all 
beggars  could  tell  such  a  good  one,  they  might  find  me  kinder.  You  may  be 
making  it  all  up,  of  course,  but  you  deserve  a  supper  for  the  story  all  the  same. 
Let's have something to eat!" 
"Yes, please!" they all said together. "Thank you very much!" 
Inside  the  hall  it was  now  quite  dark. Beorn  clapped  his  hands,  and  in  trotted 
four  beautiful  white  ponies  and  several  large  long-bodied  grey  dogs.  Beorn  said 
something  to  them  in  a  queer  language  like  animal  noises  turned  into  talk.  They 
went  out  again  and  soon  came  back  carrying  torches  in  their mouths, which  they 
lit  at  the  fire  and  stuck  in  low brackets on  the pillars of  the hall  about  the  central 
hearth. 
The  dogs  could  stand  on  their  hind-legs  when  they  wished,  and  carry  things 
with  their  fore-feet.  Quickly  they  got  out  boards  and  trestles  from  the  side  walls 
and set them up near the fire. 
Then  baa-baa-baa!  was  heard,  and  in  came  some  snow-white  sheep  led  by  a 
large  coal-black  ram.  One  bore  a  white  cloth  embroidered  at  the  edges  with 

####-figures of animals; others bore on  their broad backs  trays with bowls and platters 
and knives and wooden spoons, which the dogs took and quickly laid on the trestle 
tables.  These  were  very  low,   low  enough  even  for  Bilbo  to  sit  at  comfortably. 
Beside  them  a  pony  pushed  two  low-seated  benches  with  wide  rush-bottoms and 
little  short  thick  legs  for Gandalf  and Thorin, while  at  the  far  end  he  put Beorn's 
big  black  chair  of  the  same  sort  (in which  he  sat with his great  legs  stuck  far out 
under the table). These were all the chairs he had in his hall, and he probably had 
them  low  like  the  tables for  the convenience of  the wonderful animals  that waited 
on him. What did  the  rest sit on? They were not  forgotten. The other ponies came 
in  rolling  round  drum-shaped  sections  of  logs,  smoothed  and  polished,  and  low 
enough  even  for Bilbo;  so  soon  they were  all  seated  at Beorn's  table,  and  the hall 
had not seen such a gathering for many a year.  
There  they  had  a  supper, or  a dinner,  such  as  they had not had  since  they  left 
the Last Homely House  in  the West and  said good-bye to Elrond. The light of the 
torches  and  the  fire  flickered  about  them,  and  on  the  table  were  two  tall  red 
beeswax candles. All the time they ate, Beorn in his deep rolling voice told tales of 
the  wild  lands  on  this  side  of  the  mountains,  and  especially  of  the  dark  and 
dangerous wood,  that  lay  outstretched  far  to North  and  South  a  day's  ride  before 
them, barring their way to the East, the terrible forest of Mirkwood. 
The  dwarves  listened  and  shook  their  beards,  for  they  knew  that  they  must 
soon  venture  into  that  forest  and  that  after  the mountains  it  was  the  worst  of  the 
perils  they  had  to  pass  before  they  came  to  the  dragon's  stronghold. When  dinner 
was  over  they  began  to  tell  tales  of  their  own,  but  Beorn  seemed  to  be  growing 
drowsy  and  paid  little  heed  to  them.  They  spoke  most  of  gold  and  silver  and 
jewels  and  the making  of  things  by  smith-craft,  and Beorn did not  appear  to  care 
for  such  things:  there were no things of gold or silver in his hall, and few save the 
knives were made of metal at all. 
They  sat  long  at  the  table with  their wooden  drinking-bowls filled with mead. 
The dark night came on outside. The fires in the middle of the hall were built with 
fresh logs and the torches were put out, and still they sat in the light of the dancing 
flames with  the pillars of  the house standing  tall behind  them, arid dark at  the  top 
like  trees  of  the  forest.  Whether  it  was  magic  or  not,  it  seemed  to  Bilbo  that he 
heard  a  sound  like  wind  in  the  branches  stirring  in  the  rafters,  and  the  hoot  of 
owls.  Soon  he  began  to  nod  with  sleep  and  the  voices  seemed  to  grow  far  away, 
until he woke with a start. 
The great door had creaked and slammed. Beorn was gone. The dwarves were 
sitting  cross-legged  on  the  floor  round  the  fire,  and  presently  they  began  to  sing. 

####-Some  of  the  verses  were  like  this,  but  there  were  many  more,  and  their  singing 
went on for a long while: 
 

####-The wind was on the withered heath, 
but in the forest stirred no leaf: 
there shadows lay by night and day,  
and dark things silent crept beneath. 
The wind came down from mountains cold, 
and like a tide it roared and rolled; 
the branches groaned, the forest moaned, 
and leaves were laid upon the mould. 
 
The wind went on from West to East ;  
all movement in the forest ceased, 
but shrill and harsh across the marsh  
its whistling voices were released. 
 
The grasses hissed, their tassels bent, 
the reeds were rattling-on it went 
o' er shaken pool under heavens cool 
where racing clouds were torn and rent. 
 
It passed the lonely Mountain bare  
and swept above the dragon's lair :  
there black and dark lay boulders stark 
and flying smoke was in the air.  
 
It left the world and took its flight 
over the wide seas of the night. 
The moon set sail upon the gale, 
and stars were fanned to leaping light. 

 
Bilbo  began  to  nod  again.  Suddenly  up  stood  Gandalf.  "It  is  time  for  us  to 
sleep,"  be  said,  "—for us, but not I think for Beorn. In this hall we can rest sound 
and  safe,  but  I  warn  you  all  not  to  forget what  Beorn  said  before  he  left  us:  you 
must not stray outside until the sun is up, on your peril." 
Bilbo found that beds had already been laid at the side of the hall, on a sort of 
raised  platform  between  the  pillars  and  the  outer  wall.  For  him  there was  a  little 
mattress  of  straw  and  woollen  blankets.  He  snuggled  into  them  very  gladly, 
summertime though it was. The fire burned low and he fell asleep. Yet in the night 
he woke: the fire had now sunk to a few embers; the dwarves and Gandalf were all 
asleep,  to  judge  by  their  breathing;  a  splash  of  white  on  the  floor  came  from  the 
high moon, which was peering down through the smoke-hole in the roof. 

####-There  was  a  growling  sound  outside,  and  a  noise  as  of  some  great  animal 
scuffling  at  the  door. Bilbo .wondered what it was, and whether it could be Beorn 
in enchanted shape, and if he would come in as a bear and kill them. 
He  dived  under  the  blankets  and  hid  his  head,  and  fell  asleep  again  at  last  in 
spite of his fears. 
It was full morning when he awoke. One of the dwarves had fallen over him in 
the shadows where he lay, and had rolled down with a bump from the platform on 
to  the  floor.  It was Bofur,  and he was grumbling  about  it, when Bilbo opened his 
eyes. 
"Get up lazybones," he said, "or there will be no breakfast left for you." 
Up jumped Bilbo. "Breakfast!" he cried. "Where is breakfast?" 
"Mostly  inside us,"  answered  the other dwarves who were moving  around  the 
hall; "but what is left is out on the veranda. We have been about looking for Beorn 
ever  since  the  sun got up; but  there  is no  sign of him anywhere,  though we  found 
breakfast laid as soon as we went out." 
"Where is Gandalf?" asked Bilbo, moving off to find something to eat as quick 
as he could. 
"O!  out  and  about  somewhere,"  they  told  him.  But  he  saw  no  sign  of  the 
wizard  all  that  day  until  the  evening.  Just  before  sunset  he  walked  into  the  hall, 
where  the  hobbit  and  the  dwarves  were  having  supper,  waited  on  by  Beorn's 
wonderful  animals,  as  they  had  been  all  day.  Of  Beorn  they  had  seen  and  heard 
nothing since the night before, and they were getting puzzled. 
"Where is our host, and where have you been all day yourself?" they all cried. 
"One  question  at  a  time-and  none  till  after  supper!  I  haven't  had  a  bite  since 
breakfast." 
At  last  Gandalf  pushed  away  his  plate  and  jug  —  he  had  eaten  two  whole 
loaves  (with masses  of  butter  and  honey  and  clotted  cream)  and  drunk  at  least  a 
quart  of mead  and  he  took  out  his  pipe.  "I will  answer  the  second  question  first," 
he said, "-but bless me! this is a splendid place for smoke rings!" Indeed for a long 
time they could get nothing more out of him, he was so busy sending smoke-rings 
dodging  round  the  pillars  of  the  hall,  changing  them  into  all  sorts  of  different 
shapes and colours, and setting  them at  last chasing one another out of the hole in 
the roof. 
They must have  looked very queer  from outside, popping out  into  the  air one 
after another, green, blue, red, silver-grey, yellow, white; big ones, little ones; little 
ones dodging  through big ones  and  joining  into  figure-eights, and going off like a 
flock of birds into the distance. 

####-"I have been picking out bear-tracks," he said at last. "There must have been a 
regular  bears'  meeting  outside  here  last  night.  I  soon  saw  that  Beorn  could  not 
have  made  them  all:  there  were  far  too many  of  them,  and  they  were  of  various 
sizes  too.  I  should  say  there  were  little  bears,  large  bears,  ordinary  bears,  and 
gigantic big bears, all dancing outside from dark to nearly dawn. They came from 
almost every direction, except from the west over the river, from the Mountains. In 
that  direction  only  one  set  of  footprints  led-none  coming,  only  ones  going  away 
from here. 
I  followed  these  as  far  as  the  Carrock.  There  they  disappeared  into  the  river, 
but  the water was  too  deep  and  strong  beyond  the  rock  for me  to  cross.  It  is  easy 
enough, as you remember, to get from this bank to the Carrock by the ford, but on 
the  other  side  is  a  cliff  standing  up  from  a  swirling  channel.  I  had  to  walk miles 
before  I  found  a  place  where  the  river  was  wide  and  shallow  enough  for  me  to 
wade  and  swim,  and  then  miles  back  again  to  pick  up  the  tracks  again.  By  that 
time  it  was  too  late  for  me  to  follow  them  far.  They  went  straight  off  in  the 
direction of the pine-woods on the east side of the Misty Mountains, where we had 
our  pleasant  little  party  with  the  Wargs  the  night  before  last.  And  now  I  think  I 
have  answered  your  first  question,  too,"  ended  Gandalf,  and  he  sat  a  long  while 
silent. 
Bilbo  thought  he  knew what  the wizard meant.  "What  shall we  do,"  he  cried, 
"if  he  leads  all  the Wargs  and  the  goblins  down  here? We  shall  all  be  caught  and 
killed! I thought you said he was not 9 friend of theirs." 
"So I did. And don't be silly! You had better go to bed, your wits are sleepy." 
The hobbit felt quite crushed, and as there seemed nothing else to do he did go 
to  bed;  and  while  the  dwarves  were  still  singing  songs  he  dropped  asleep,  still 
puzzling his little head about Beorn, till he dreamed a dream of hundreds of black 
bears  dancing  slow  heavy  dances  round  and  round  in  the  moonlight  in  the 
courtyard.  Then  he  woke  up  when  everyone  else  was  asleep,  and  he  heard  the 
same  scraping,  scuffling,  snuffling,  and  growling  as  before.  Next  morning  they 
were all wakened by Beorn himself. 
"So here you all are still!" he said. He picked up the hobbit and laughed: "Not 
eaten  up  by  Wargs  or  goblins  or  wicked  bears  yet  I  see";  and  he  poked  Mr. 
Baggins' waistcoat most disrespectfully. "Little bunny is getting nice and fat again 
on bread and honey," he chuckled. "Come and have some more!" 
 
So  they  all  went  to  breakfast  with  him.  Beorn  was  most  jolly  for  a  change; 
indeed  he  seemed  to  be  in  a  splendidly  good  humour  and  set  them  all  laughing 

####-with his funny stories; nor did they have to wonder long where he had been or why 
he  was  so  nice  to  them,  for he  told  them himself. He had been over  the  river  and 
right  back  up  into  the  mountains-from  which  you  can  guess  that  he  could  travel 
quickly,  in bear's  shape  at  any  rate. From  the burnt wolf-glade he had soon found 
out  that  part  of  their  story  was  true;  but  he  had  found  more  than  that:  he  had 
caught a Warg and a goblin wandering in the woods. From these he had got news: 
the  goblin  patrols  were  still  hunting  with  Wargs  for  the  dwarves,  and  they  were 
fiercely  angry  because  of  the  death  of  the  Great  Goblin,  and  also  because  of  the 
burning of the chief wolf's nose and the death from the wizard's fire of many of his 
chief  servants. So much  they  told him when he  forced  them, but he guessed  there 
was  more  wickedness  than  this  afoot,  and  that  a  great  raid  of  the  whole  goblin 
army with  their wolf-allies  into  the  lands  shadowed by  the mountains might  soon 
be made  to  find  the  dwarves,  or  to  take  vengeance  on  the men  and  creatures  that 
lived there, and who they thought must be sheltering them. 
"It was  a  good  story,  that of yours," said Beorn, "but I like it still better now I 
am sure it is true. You must forgive my not taking your word. If you lived near the 
edge of Mirkwood, you would  take  the word of no one  that you did not know  as 
well  as  your  brother  or  better. As  it is, I can only say that I have hurried home as 
fast  as  I  could  to  see  that  you  were  safe,  and  to  offer  you  any  help  that  I  can.  I 
shall  think more  kindly  of  dwarves  after  this. Killed  the Great Goblin,  killed  the 
Great Goblin!" he chuckled fiercely to himself. 
"What did you do with the goblin and the Warg?" asked Bilbo suddenly.  
"Come  and  see!"  said  Beorn,  and  they  followed  round  the  house.  A  goblin's 
head was  stuck  outside  the  gate  and  a warg-skin was nailed to a tree just beyond. 
Beorn  was  a  fierce  enemy.  But  now  he  was  their  friend,  and  Gandalf  thought  it 
wise  to  tell  him  their  whole  story  and  the  reason  of  their  journey,  so  that  they 
could get the most help he could offer.  
This is what he promised to do for them. He would provide ponies for each of 
them,  and  a  horse  for Gandalf,  for  their  journey  to  the  forest,  and  he would  lade 
them with food to last them for weeks with care, and packed so as to be as easy as 
possible to carry-nuts, flour, sealed jars of dried fruits, and red earthenware pots of 
honey,  and twice-baked cakes that would keep good a long time, and on a little of 
which they could march far. The making of these was one of his secrets; but honey 
was in them, as in most of his foods, and they were good to eat, though they made 
one  thirsty. Water, he said, they would not need to carry this side of the forest, for 
there were streams and springs along  the road. "But your way  through Mirkwood 
is  dark,  dangerous  and  difficult,"  he  said.  "Water  is  not  easy  to  find  there,  nor 

####-food.  The  time  is  not  yet  come  for  nuts  (though  it may  be  past  and  gone  indeed 
before  you  get  to  the  other  side),  and  nuts  are  about  all  that  grows  there  fit  for 
food;  in  there  the wild  things are dark, queer, and savage. I will provide you with 
skins  for  carrying water,  and  I will give you  some bows  and  arrows. But  I doubt 
very much whether anything you find in Mirkwood will be wholesome to eat or to 
drink. There is one stream there, I know, black and strong which crosses the path. 
That  you  should  neither  drink  of,  nor  bathe  in;  for  I  have  heard  that  it  carries 
enchantment and a great drowsiness and forgetfulness. And in the dim shadows of 
that  place  I  don't  think  you  will  shoot  anything,  wholesome  or  unwholesome, 
without straying from the path. That you MUST NOT do, for any reason. "That is 
all  the  advice  I  can  give  you.  Beyond  the  edge  of  the  forest  I  cannot  help  you 
much;  you must  depend  on  your  luck  and  your  courage  and  the  food  I  send with 
you. At the gate of the forest I must ask you to send back my horse and my ponies. 
But I wish you all speed, and my house is open to you, if ever you come back this 
way again." 
They  thanked  him,  of  course,  with  many  bows  and  sweepings  of  their  hoods 
and with many an "at your service, O master of the wide wooden halls!" But their 
spirits  sank  at  his  grave  words,  and  they  all  felt  that  the  adventure  was  far more 
dangerous  than  they  had  thought,  while  all  the  time,  even  if  they  passed  all  the 
perils of the road, the dragon was waiting at the end. 
All that morning they were busy with preparations. Soon after midday they ate 
with  Beorn  for  the  last  time,  and  after  the  meal  they  mounted  the  steeds  he  was 
lending  them, and bidding him many  farewells  they  rode off  through his gate at a 
good pace. 
As  soon as  they  left his high hedges at  the east of his  fenced lands they turned 
north  and  then  bore  to  the  north-west. By his  advice  they were no  longer making 
for  the main  forest-road to the south of his land. Had they followed the pass, their 
path  would  have  led  them  down  the  stream  from  the  mountains  that  joined  the 
great  river miles  south  of  the Carrock. At  that  point  there was  a  deep  ford which 
they might have passed,  if  they had  still had  their ponies, and beyond  that a  track 
led  to  the  skirts of  the wood and  to  the entrance of  the old  forest  road. But Beorn 
had  warned  them  that  that  way  was  now  often  used  by  the  goblins,  while  the 
forest-road itself, he bad heard, was overgrown and disused at the eastern end and 
led  to  impassable marshes where  the paths had  long been  lost.  Its eastern opening 
had also always been far to the south of the Lonely Mountain, and would have left 
them  still  with  a  long  and  difficult  northward  march  when  they  got  to  the  other 
side. 

####-North  of  the Carrock  the  edge  of Mirkwood  drew  closer  to  the  borders  of  the 
Great River, and though here the Mountains too drew down nearer, Beorn advised 
them to take this way; for at a place a few days' ride due north of the Carrock was 
the  gate  of  a  little-known  pathway  through  Mirkwood  that  led  almost  straight 
towards the Lonely Mountain. 
"The  goblins,"  Beorn  had  said,  "will  not  dare  to  cross  the  Great  River  for  a 
hundred  miles  north  of  the  Carrock  nor  to  come  near  my  house  –  it  is  well 
protected  at  night!–  but  I  should  ride  fast;  for  if  they  make  their  raid  soon  they 
will cross the river to the south  and scour all the edge of the forest so as to cut you 
off,  and  Wargs  run  swifter  than  ponies.  Still  you  are  safer  going  north,  even 
though you seem to be going back nearer to their strongholds; for that is what they 
will  least  expect,  and  they  will  have  the  longer  ride  to  catch  you.  Be  off  now  as 
quick as you may!" 
That  is  why  they  were  now  riding  in  silence,  galloping  wherever  the  ground 
was grassy and  smooth, with  the mountains dark on  their  left, and  in  the distance 
the line of the river with its trees drawing ever closer. The sun had only just turned 
west  when  they  started,  and  till  evening  it  lay  golden  on  the  land  about  them.  It 
was  difficult  to  think  of  pursuing  goblins  behind,  and  when  they  had  put  many 
miles between them and Beorn's house they began to talk and to sing again and to 
forget  the  dark  forest-path  that  lay  in  front.  But  in  the  evening  when  the  dusk 
came on and  the peaks of  the mountains glowered against  the  sunset  they made a 
camp and set a guard, and most of them slept uneasily with dreams in which there 
came  the  howl  of  hunting wolves  and  the  cries  of  goblins.  Still  the  next morning 
dawned bright and fair again. 
There  was  an  autumn-like mist  white  upon  the  ground  and  the  air  was  chill, 
but  soon  the  sun  rose  red  in  the  East  and  the  mists  vanished,  and  while  the 
shadows were still long they were off again. So they rode now for two more days, 
and all  the while  they saw nothing save grass and  flowers and birds and scattered 
trees,  and  occasionally  small  herds  of  red  deer  browsing  or  sitting  at noon  in  the 
shade.  Sometimes  Bilbo  saw  the  horns  of  the  harts  sticking  up  out  of  the  long 
grass,  and  at  first  he  thought  they  were  the  dead  branches  of  trees.  That  third 
evening  they were so eager  to press on,  for Beorn had said  that  they should  reach 
the  forest-gate  early  on  the  fourth  day,  that  they  rode  still  forward  after  dusk  and 
into  the night beneath  the moon. As  the  light faded Bilbo  thought he saw away  to 
the  right,  or  to  the  left,  the  shadowy  form  of  a  great  bear  prowling  along  in  the 
same  direction.  But  if  he  dared  to  mention  it  to  Gandalf,  the  wizard  only  said: 
"Hush! Take no notice!" 

####-Next day they started before dawn, though their night had been short. As soon 
as it was light they could see the forest coming as it were to meet them, or waiting 
for  them  like a black and  frowning wall before  them. The  land began  to  slope up 
and  up,  and  it  seemed  to  the  hobbit  that  a  silence  began  to  draw  in  upon  them. 
Birds  began  to  sing  less.  There  were  no  more  deer;  not  even  rabbits  were  to  be 
seen. By  the  afternoon they had reached the eaves of Mirkwood, and were resting 
almost beneath  the great overhanging boughs of  its outer  trees. Their  trunks were 
huge  and  gnarled,  their  branches  twisted,  their  leaves  were  dark  and  long.  Ivy 
grew on them and trailed along the ground. 
"Well,  here  is  Mirkwood!"  said  Gandalf.  "The  greatest  of  the  forests  of  the 
Northern  world.  I  hope  you  like  the  look  of  it.  Now  you  must  send  back  these 
excellent ponies you have borrowed." 
The  dwarves  were  inclined  to  grumble  at  this,  but  the  wizard  told  them  they 
were  fools. "Beorn  is not as  far off as you seem  to  think, and you had better keep 
your promises  anyway,  for he  is  a bad  enemy. Mr. Baggins'  eyes  are  sharper  than 
yours,  if you have not seen each night after dark a great bear going along with us 
or sitting far of in the moon watching our camps. Not only to guard you and guide 
you, but to keep an eye on the ponies too. Beorn may be your friend, but he loves 
his animals as his children. You do not guess what kindness he has  shown you  in 
letting dwarves ride them so far and so fast, nor what would happen to you, if you 
tried to take them into the forest." 
"What  about  the  horse,  then?"  said  Thorin.  "You  don't  mention  sending  that 
back." 
"I don't, because I am not sending it." 
"What about your promise then?" 
"I will look after that. I am not sending the horse back, I am riding it!" 
Then  they  knew  that  Gandalf  was  going  to  leave  them  at  the  very  edge  of 
Mirkwood, and they were in despair.  
But nothing they could say would change his mind. 
"Now we had this all out before, when we landed on the Carrock," he said. "It 
is no use arguing. I have, as I  told you, some pressing business away south; and I 
am already late through bothering with you people. We may meet again before all 
is  over,  and  then  again of  course we may not. That depends on your  luck  and on 
your courage and  sense; and  I am  sending Mr. Baggins with you.  I have  told you 
before  that  he  has  more  about  him  than  you  guess,  and  you  will  find  that  out 
before  long.  So  cheer  up  Bilbo  and  don't  look  so  glum.  Cheer  up  Thorin  and 

####-Company! This  is  your  expedition  after  all. Think  of  the  treasure  at  the  end,  and 
forget the forest and the dragon, at any rate until tomorrow morning!" 
When tomorrow morning came he still said the same. 
So  now  there  was  nothing  left  to  do  but  to  fill  their  water-skins  at  a  clear 
spring they found close to the forest-gate, and unpack the ponies. They distributed 
the  packages  as  fairly  as  they  could,  though  Bilbo  thought  his  lot  was 
wearisomely heavy, and did not at all like  the idea of trudging for miles and miles 
with all that on his back. 
"Don't you worry!" said Thorin. "It will get  lighter all  too soon. Before  long  I 
expect we shall all wish our packs heavier, when the food begins to run short." 
Then  at  last  they  said  good-bye  to  their  ponies  and  turned  their  heads  for 
home.  Off  they  trotted  gaily,  seeming  very  glad  to  put  their  tails  towards  the 
shadow of Mirkwood. As they went away Bilbo could have sworn that a thing like 
a bear left the shadow of the trees and shambled off quickly after them. 
Now Gandalf  too  said  farewell. Bilbo  sat on  the ground  feeling very unhappy 
and wishing he was beside the wizard on his tall horse. He had gone just inside the 
forest  after  breakfast  (a  very  poor  one),  and  it  had  seemed  as  dark  in  there  in  the 
morning  as  at  night,  and  very  secret:  "a  sort  of watching  and waiting  feeling,"  he 
said to himself. 
"Good-bye!"  said  Gandalf  to  Thorin.  "And  good-bye  to  you  all,  good-bye! 
Straight through the forest is your way now. Don't stray off the track!-if you do, it 
is  a  thousand  to one you will never  find  it  again  and never get out of Mirkwood; 
and then I don't suppose I, or any one else, will ever see you again." 
"Do we really have to go through?" groaned the hobbit. 
"Yes, you do!" said the wizard, "if  you want to get to the other side. You must 
either go through or give up your quest. And I am not going to allow you to back 
out  now,  Mr.  Baggins.  I  am  ashamed  of  you  for  thinking  of  it.  You  have  got  to 
look after all these dwarves for me," he laughed. 
"No! no!" said Bilbo. "I didn't mean that. I meant, is there no way round?" 
"There is, if you care to go two hundred miles or so out of your way north, and 
twice  that  south.  But  you  wouldn't  get  a  safe  path  even  then.  There  are  no  safe 
paths  in  this part of  the world. Remember you are over the Edge of the Wild now, 
and in for all sorts of fun wherever you go. Before you could get round Mirkwood 
in  the  North  you  would  be  right  among  the  slopes  of  the  Grey  Mountains,  and 
they  are  simply  stiff  with  goblins,  hobgoblins,  and  rest  of  the  worst  description. 
Before  you  could  get  round  it  in  the  South,  you  would  get  into  the  land  of  the 
Necromancer;  and  even  you.  Bilbo, won't  need me  to  tell  you  tales  of  that  black 

####-sorcerer. I don't advise you to go anywhere near the places overlooked by his dark 
tower! Stick  to  the  forest-track, keep your spirits up, hope for the best, and with a 
tremendous  slice  of  luck  you  may  come  out  one  day  and  see  the  Long  Marshes 
lying  below  you,  and  beyond  them,  high  in  the East,  the Lonely Mountain where 
dear old Smaug lives, though I hope he is not expecting you." 
"Very  comforting  you  are  to  be  sure,"  growled  Thorin.  "Good-bye!  If  you 
won't come with us, you had better get off without any more talk!" 
"Good-bye  then,  and  really  good-bye!"  said  Gandalf,  and  he  turned  his  horse 
and  rode  down  into  the West.  But  he  could  not  resist  the  temptation  to  have  the 
last word. Before he had passed quite out of hearing he turned and put his hands to 
his mouth  and  called  to  them. They  heard  his  voice  come  faintly:  "Good-bye! Be 
good, take care of yourselves-and DON'T LEAVE THE PATH!" 
Then he galloped away and was soon lost to sight. "O good-bye and go away!" 
grunted  the  dwarves,  all  the  more  angry  because  they  were  really  filled  with 
dismay at losing him. Now began the most dangerous part of all the journey.  
They  each  shouldered  the  heavy  pack  and  the  water-skin  which  was  their 
share, and turned from the light that lay on the lands outside and plunged into the 
forest.  
 

####-<h4>Chapter 8 </h4> <br>

Flies and Spiders 

 
They  walked  in  single  file.  The  entrance  to  the  path  was  like  a  sort  of  arch 
leading  into  a  gloomy  tunnel made  by  two  great  trees  that  leant  together,  too  old 
and  strangled  with  ivy  and  hung  with  lichen  to  bear  more  than  a  few  blackened 
leaves. The  path  itself was  narrow and wound in and out among the trunks. Soon 
the  light  at  the  gate  was  like  a  little  bright  hole  far  behind,  and  the  quiet  was  so 
deep that their feet seemed to thump along while all the trees leaned over them and 
listened. As  theft  eyes  became  used  to  the  dimness  they  could  see  a  little way  to 
either  side  in  a  sort  of  darkened  green  glimmer.  Occasionally  a  slender  beam  of 
sun  that had  the  luck  to slip  in  through some opening  in  the  leaves far above, and 
still  more  luck  in  not  being  caught  in  the  tangled  boughs  and  matted  twigs 
beneath,  stabbed  down  thin  and  bright  before  them.  But  this  was  seldom,  and  it 
soon ceased altogether.  
There were  black  squirrels  in  the wood. As  Bilbo's  sharp  inquisitive  eyes  got 
used  to  seeing  things  he  could  catch  glimpses  of  them whisking  off  the  path  and 
scuttling  behind  tree-trunks.  There  were  queer  noises  too,  grunts,  scufflings,  and 
hurryings  in  the undergrowth, and among  the  leaves  that  lay piled endlessly  thick 
in  places  on  the  forest-floor;  but  what  made  the  noises  he  could  not  see.  The 
nastiest  things  they  saw  were  the  cobwebs:  dark  dense  cobwebs  with  threads 
extraordinarily  thick,  often  stretched  from  tree  to  tree,  or  tangled  in  the  lower 
branches  on  either  side  of  them.  There  were  none  stretched  across  the  path,  but 
whether because some magic kept it clear, or for what other reason they could not 
guess. 
It was not long before they grew to hate the forest as heartily as they had hated 
the tunnels of the goblins, and it seemed to offer even less hope of any ending. But 
they had to go on and on, long after they were sick for a sight of the sun and of the 
sky, and  longed for  the feel of wind on  their faces. There was no movement of air 
down under the forest-roof, and it was everlastingly still and dark and stuffy. Even 
the dwarves felt it, who were used to tunnelling, and lived at times for long whiles 
without the light of the sun; but the hobbit, who liked holes to make a house in but 
not to spend summer days in, felt he was being slowly suffocated. 
The nights were the worst. It then became pitch-dark – not what you call pitch-
dark,  but  really  pitch;  so  black  that  you  really  could  see  nothing.  Bilbo  tried 
flapping his hand in front of his nose, but he could not see it at all. Well, perhaps it 

####-is  not  true  to  say  that  they  could  see  nothing:  they  could  see  eyes. They  slept  all 
closely  huddled  together,  and  took  it  in  turns  to  watch;  and  when  it  was  Bilbo's 
turn  he  would  see  gleams  in  the  darkness  round  them,  and  sometimes  pairs  of 
yellow  or  red  or  green  eyes  would  stare  at  him  from  a  little  distance,  and  then 
slowly  fade  and  disappear  and  slowly  shine  out  again  in  another  place.  And 
sometimes  they  would  gleam  down  from  the  branches  just  above  him;  and  that 
was most terrifying. But the eyes that he liked the least were horrible pale bulbous 
sort  of  eyes.  "Insect  eyes"  he  thought,  "not  animal  eyes,  only  they  are  much  too 
big." 
Although  it was  not  yet  very  cold,  they  tried  lighting watch-fires at night, but 
they  soon  gave  that  up.  It  seemed  to  bring  hundreds  and  hundreds  of  eyes  all 
round  them,  though  the  creatures,  whatever  they  were,  were  careful  never  to  let 
their bodies show in the little flicker of the flames. Worse still it brought thousands 
of  dark-grey  and  black  moths,  some  nearly  as  big  as  your  hand,  flapping  and 
whirring  round their ears. They could not stand that, nor the huge bats, black as a 
top-hat,  either;  so  they  gave  up  fires  and  sat  at  night  and  dozed  in  the  enormous 
uncanny darkness. 
All  this  went  on  for  what  seemed  to  the  hobbit  ages  upon  ages;  and  he  was 
always  hungry,  for  they were extremely careful with  their provisions. Even  so, as 
days  followed  days,  and  still  the  forest  seemed  just  the  same,  they  began  to  get 
anxious. The  food would not  last  for  ever:  it was  in  fact  already beginning  to get 
low. They tried shooting at the squirrels, and they wasted many arrows before they 
managed  to  bring  one  down  on  the  path.  But  when  they  roasted  it,  it  proved 
horrible to taste, and they shot no more squirrels. 
They  were  thirsty  too,  for  they  had  none  too  much  water,  and  in  all  the  time 
they  had  seen  neither  spring  nor  stream.  This  was  their  state  when  one  day  they 
found their path blocked by a running water. It flowed fast and strong but not very 
wide right across  the way, and  it was black, or  looked  it  in  the gloom. It was well 
that  Beorn  had  warned  them  against  it,  or  they  would  have  drunk  from  it, 
whatever  its  colour,  and  filled  some  of  their  emptied  skins  at  its  bank. As  it was 
they only thought of how to cross it without wetting themselves in its water. There 
had  been  a  bridge  of  wood  across,  but  it  had  rotted  and  fallen  leaving  only  the 
broken posts near the bank. 
Bilbo kneeling on the brink and peering forward cried: "There is a boat against 
the far bank! Now why couldn't it have been this side!" 
"How far away do you think it is?" asked Thorin, for by now they knew Bilbo 
had the sharpest eyes among them. 

####-"Not at all far. I shouldn't think above twelve yards." 
"Twelve  yards!  I  should  have  thought  it was  thirty  at  least,  but my  eyes  don't 
see  as  well  as  they  used  a  hundred  years  ago.  Still  twelve  yards  is  as  good  as  a 
mile. We can't jump it, and we daren't try to wade or swim." 
"Can any of you throw a rope?" 
"What's the good of that? The boat is sure to be tied up, even if we could hook 
it, which I doubt." 
"I  don't  believe  it  is  tied,"  said Bilbo,  "though of  course  I  can't be  sure  in  this 
light;  but  it  looks  to me  as  if  it was  just  drawn  up  on  the  bank, which  is  low  just 
there where the path goes down into the water." 
"Dori is the strongest, but Fili is the youngest and still  has the best sight," said 
Thorin.  "Come  here  Fili,  and  see  if  you  can  see  the  boat  Mr.  Baggins  is  talking 
about." 
Fili thought he could; so when he had stared a long while to get an idea of the 
direction,  the  others  brought  him  a  rope.  They  had  several with  them, and on  the 
end  of  the  longest  they  fastened  one  of  the  large  iron  hooks  they  had  used  for 
catching  their packs  to  the  straps  about  their  shoulders. Fili  took  this  in his hand, 
balanced it for a moment, and then flung it across the stream. 
Splash  it  fell  in  the  water!  "Not  far  enough!"  said  Bilbo  who  was  peering 
forward.  "A  couple  of  feet  and  you  would  have  dropped  it  on  to  the  boat.  Try 
again.  I don't  suppose  the magic  is  strong  enough  to hurt you,  if you  just  touch  a 
bit of wet rope." 
Fili  picked  up  the  hook when  he  had  drawn  it  back,  rather  doubtfully  all  the 
same. This time he threw it with greater strength. 
"Steady!" said Bilbo, "you have thrown it right into the wood on the other side 
now.  Draw  it  back  gently."  Fili  hauled  the  rope  back  slowly,  and  after  a  while 
Bilbo said: 
"Carefully! It is lying on the boat; let's hope the hook will catch." 
It  did.  The  rope went  taut,  and  Fili  pulled  in  vain. Kili  came  to  his  help,  and 
then  Oin  and  Gloin.  They  tugged  and  tugged,  and  suddenly  they  all  fell  over  on 
their backs. Bilbo was on  the  lockout, however, caught  the rope, and with a piece 
of  stick  fended  off  the  little  black  boat  as  it  came  rushing  across  the  stream. 
"Help!"  he  shouted,  and Balin was  just  in  time  to  seize  the  boat  before  it  floated 
off down the current. 
"It  was  tied  after  all,"  said  he,  looking  at  the  snapped  painter  that  was  still 
dangling  from  it.  "That  was  a  good  pull,  my  lads;  and  a  good  job  that  our  rope 
was the stronger." 

####-"Who'll cross first?" asked Bilbo. 
"I  shall,"  said Thorin,  "and  you will come with me, and Fili and Balin. That's 
as  many  as  the  boat  will  hold  at  a  time.  After  that  Kili  and  Oin  and  Gloin  and 
Don; next On and Nori, Bifur and Bofur; and last Dwalin and Bombur." 
"I'm  always  last  and  I  don't  like  it,"  said  Bombur.  "It's  somebody  else's  turn 
today." 
"You  should  not  be  so  fat. As  you  are,  you must  be with  the  last  and  lightest 
boatload.  Don't  start  grumbling  against  orders,  or  something  bad  will  happen  to 
you." 
"There  aren't  any  oars.  How  are  you  going  to  push  the  boat  back  to  the  far 
bank?" asked the hobbit. 
"Give me  another  length  of  rope  and  another  hook,"  said  Fili,  and when  they 
had got  it  ready, he cast  into  the darkness ahead and as high as he could  throw  it. 
Since  it did not  fall down again,  they saw  that  it must have stuck in the branches. 
"Get  in now," said Fili, "and one of you haul on  the rope  that  is stuck  in a  tree on 
the other  side. One of  the others must keep hold of  the hook we used  at  first,  and 
when we  are  safe  on  the  other  side  he  can  hook  it  on,  and  you  can draw  the boat 
back." 
In  this  way  they  were  all  soon  on  the  far  bank  safe  across  the  enchanted 
stream.  Dwalin  had  just  scrambled  out  with  the  coiled  rope  on  his  arm,  and 
Bombur  (still  grumbling)  was  getting  ready  to  follow,  when  something  bad  did 
happen. There was a  flying  sound of hooves on  the path ahead. Out of  the gloom 
came suddenly  the shape of a  flying deer.  It charged  into  the dwarves and bowled 
them  over,  then  gathered  itself  for  a  leap.  High  it  sprang  and  cleared  the  water 
with  a  mighty  jump.  But  it  did  not  reach  the  other  side  in  safety. Thorin was  the 
only  one  who  had  kept  his  feet  and  his  wits.  As  soon  as  they  had  landed  he  had 
bent his bow and fitted an arrow in case any hidden guardian of the boat appeared. 
Now he  sent  a  swift  and  sure  shot  into the leaping beast. As it reached the further 
bank  it  stumbled.  The  shadows  swallowed  it  up,  but  they  heard  the  sound  of 
hooves quickly falter and then go still. 
Before  they  could  shout  in  praise  of  the  shot,  however,  a  dreadful  wail  from 
Bilbo  put  all  thoughts  of  venison  out  of  their  minds.  "Bombur  has  fallen  in! 
Bombur is drowning!" he cried. It was only too true. Bombur had only one foot on 
the land when the hart bore down on him, and sprang over him. He had stumbled, 
thrusting the boat away from the bank, and then toppled back into the dark water, 
his  hands  slipping  off  the  slimy  roots  at  the  edge,  while  the  boat  span  slowly  off 
and disappeared. 

####-They  could  still  see  his  hood  above  the  water  when  they  ran  to  the  bank. 
Quickly  they  flung  a  rope with  a  hook towards him. His hand caught it, and they 
pulled  him  to  the  shore.  He  was  drenched  from  hair  to  boots,  of  course,  but  that 
was  not  the  worst.  When  they  laid  him  on  the  bank  he  was  already  fast  asleep, 
with one hand clutching the rope so tight that they could not get it from his grasp; 
and  fast asleep he  remained  in  spite of all  they could do. They were  still  standing 
over him,  cursing  their  ill  luck,  and Bombur's  clumsiness,  and  lamenting  the  loss 
of  the  boat  which  made  it  impossible  for  them  to  go  back  and  look  for  the  hart, 
when  they became  aware of  the dim blowing of horns  in  the wood  and  the  sound 
as  of  dogs  baying  far  off.  Then  they  all  fell  silent;  and  as  they  sat  it  seemed  they 
could hear  the noise of a great hunt going by  to  the north of  the path, though they 
saw no sign of it. There they sat for a long while and did not dare to make a move. 
Bombur  slept  on with  a  smile  on  his  fat  face,  as  if  he  no  longer  cared  for  all  the 
troubles that vexed them. 
Suddenly  on  the  path  ahead  appeared  some  white  deer,  a  hind  and  fawns  as 
snowy  white  as  the  hart  had  been  dark.  They  glimmered  in  the  shadows.  Before 
Thorin  could  cry  out  three  of  the  dwarves  had  leaped  to  their  feet  and  loosed  off 
arrows  from  their  bows.  None  seemed  to  find  their  mark.  The  deer  turned  and 
vanished  in  the  trees  as  silently  as  they  had  come,  and  in  vain  the  dwarves  shot 
their arrows after them. 
"Stop!  stop!"  shouted  Thorin;  but  it  was  too  late,  the  excited  dwarves  had 
wasted  their  last  arrows,  and  now  the  bows  that  Beorn  had  given  them  were 
useless. 
They  were  a  gloomy  party  that  night,  and  the  gloom  gathered  still  deeper  on 
them in the following days. They had crossed the enchanted stream; but beyond it 
the  path  seemed  to  straggle  on  just  as  before,  and  in  the  forest  they  could  see  no 
change.  Yet  if  they  had  known  more  about  it  and  considered  the  meaning  of  the 
hunt  and  the  white  deer  that  had  appeared  upon  their  path,  they  would  have 
known  that  they  were  at  last  drawing  towards  the  eastern  edge,  and  would  soon 
have  come,  if  they  could  have  kept  up  their  courage  and  their  hope,  to  thinner 
trees and places where the sunlight came again. 
But  they  did  not  know  this,  and  they  were  burdened  with  the  heavy  body  of 
Bombur,  which  they  had  to  carry  along  with  them  as  best  they  could,  taking  the 
wearisome  task  in  turns  of  four  each while  the  others  shared  their  packs.  If  these 
had not become all too light in the last few days, they would never have managed 
it;  but  a  slumbering  and  smiling  Bombur  was  a  poor  exchange  for  packs  filled 
with  food  however  heavy.  In  a  few  days  a  time  came when  there was  practically 

####-nothing  left  to  eat  or  to  drink. Nothing wholesome  could  they  see  growing  in  the 
woods, only funguses and herbs with pale leaves and unpleasant smell. 
About four days from the enchanted stream they  came to a part where most of 
the trees were beeches. They were at first inclined to be cheered by the change, for 
here  there  was  no  undergrowth  and  the  shadow  was  not  so  deep.  There  was  a 
greenish light about them, and in places they could see some distance to either side 
of  the  path.  Yet  the  light  only  showed  them  endless  lines  of  straight  grey  trunks 
like the pillars of some huge twilight hall. There was a breath of air and a noise of 
wind,  but  it  had  a  sad  sound.  A  few  leaves  came  rustling  down  to  remind  them 
that  outside  autumn was  coming  on.  Their  feet  ruffled  among  the  dead  leaves  of 
countless other  autumns  that drifted over  the banks of  the path  from  the deep  red 
carpets of the forest. 
Still Bombur  slept  and  they grew very weary. At  times  they heard disquieting 
laughter.  Sometimes  there  was  singing  in  the  distance  too.  The  laughter  was  the 
laughter of fair voices not of goblins, and the singing was beautiful, but it sounded 
eerie and  strange, and  they were not comforted,  rather  they hurried on  from  those 
parts with what strength they had left. 
Two  days  later  they  found  their  path  going  downwards  and  before  long  they 
were in a valley filled almost entirely with a mighty growth of oaks. 
"Is there no end to this accursed forest?" said Thorin. 
"Somebody must climb a tree and see if he can get his head above the roof and 
have  a  look  round.  The  only  way  is  to  choose  the  tallest  tree  that  overhangs  the 
path." 
Of course "somebody" meant Bilbo. They chose him because  to be of any use 
the  climber  must  get  his  head  above  the  topmost  leaves,  and  so  he must  be  light 
enough for the highest and slenderest branches to bear him. Poor Mr. Baggins had 
never had much practice in climbing trees, but they hoisted him up into the lowest 
branches of an enormous oak that grew right out into the path, and up he had to go 
as best he could. He pushed his way through the tangled twigs with many a slap in 
the eye; he was greened and grimed from the old bark of the greater boughs; more 
than  once  he  slipped  and  caught  himself  just  in  time; and at  last, after a dreadful 
struggle  in  a  difficult  place  where  there  seemed  to  be  no  convenient  branches  at 
all, he got near the top. All the time he was wondering whether there were spiders 
in the tree, and how he was going to get down again (except by falling). 
In  the  end  he  poked  his  head  above  the  roof  of  leaves,  and  then  he  found 
spiders  all  right.  But  they  were  only  small  ones  of  ordinary  size,  and  they  were 
after  the  butterflies.  Bilbo's  eyes  were  nearly  blinded  by  the  light.  He  could  hear 

####-the dwarves shouting up at him from far below, but he could not answer, only hold 
on  and  blink.  The  sun  was  shining  brilliantly,  and  it  was  a  long  while  before  he 
could  bear  it. When  he  could,  he  saw  all  round  him  a  sea  of  dark  green,  ruffled 
here  and  there  by the breeze; and there were everywhere hundreds of butterflies. I 
expect  they were a kind of  'purple emperor,' a butterfly  that  loves  the  tops of oak-
woods,  but  these  were  not  purple  at  all,  they  were  a  dark  dark  velvety  black 
without any markings to be seen. 
He  looked  at  the  'black  emperors'  for  a  long  time,  and  enjoyed  the  feel  of  the 
breeze in his hair and on his face; but at length the cries of the dwarves, who were 
now  simply  stamping  with  impatience  down  below,  reminded  him  of  his  real 
business.  It  was  no  good.  Gaze  as much  as  he might,  he  could  see  no  end  to  the 
trees  and  the  leaves  in  any  direction.  His  heart,  that  had  been  lightened  by  the 
sight of the sun and the feel of the wind, sank back into his toes: there was no food 
to go back to down below.  
Actually, as I have told you, they were not far off the edge of the forest; and if 
Bilbo had had the sense to see it, the tree that he had climbed, though it was tall in 
itself, was standing near  the bottom of a wide valley, so  that  from  its  top  the  trees 
seemed  to  swell  up  all  round  like  the  edges  of  a  great  bowl,  and  he  could  not 
expect  to  see  how  far  the  forest  lasted.  Still  he  did  not  see  this,  and  he  climbed 
down  full  of  despair.  He  got  to  the  bottom  again  at  last  scratched,  hot,  and 
miserable,  and  he  could  not  see  anything  in  the  gloom  below  when  he  got  there. 
His report soon made the others as miserable as he was. 
"The forest goes on for ever and ever and ever in all directions! Whatever shall 
we do? And what  is  the use of sending a hobbit!"  they cried, as if it was his fault. 
They did not care tuppence about the butterflies, and were only made more angry 
when he told them of the beautiful breeze, which they were too heavy to climb up 
and feel. 
 
That  night  they  ate  their  very  last  scraps  and  crumbs  of  food;  and  next 
morning  when  they  woke  the  first  thing  they  noticed  was  that  they  were  still 
gnawingly  hungry,  and  the  next  thing  was  that  it  was  raining  and  that  here  and 
there  the  drip  of  it  was  dropping  heavily  on  the  forest  floor.  That  only  reminded 
them  that  they  were  also  parchingly  thirsty,  without  doing  anything  to  relieve 
them: you cannot quench a terrible thirst by standing under giant oaks and waiting 
for  a  chance  drip  to  fall  on  your  tongue.  The  only  scrap  of  comfort  there  was, 
came unexpectedly from Bombur.  

####-He woke  up  suddenly  and  sat  up  scratching  his  head. He  could  not make  out 
where  he  was  at  all,  nor  why  he  felt  so  hungry;  for  he  had  forgotten  everything 
that  had  happened  since  they  started  their  journey  that  May  morning  long  ago. 
The  last  thing  that  he  remembered  was  the  party  at  the  hobbit's  house,  and  they 
had  great  difficulty  in  making  him  believe  their  tale  of  all  the  many  adventures 
they had had since. 
When he heard that there was nothing to eat, he sat down and wept, for he felt 
very  weak  and  wobbly  in  the  legs.  "Why  ever  did  I  wake  up!"  he  cried.  "I  was 
having such beautiful dreams. I dreamed I was walking in a forest rather like this 
one,  only  lit with  torches  on  the  trees  and  lamps  swinging  from  the  branches  and 
fires  burning  on  the  ground;  and  there  was  a  great  feast  going  on,  going  on  for 
ever.  A  woodland  king  was  there  with  a  crown  of  leaves,  and  there  was  a merry 
singing, and I could not count or describe the things there were to eat and drink." 
"You need not try," said Thorin. "In fact if you can't talk about something else, 
you  had  better  be  silent.  We  are  quite  annoyed  enough  with  you  as  it  is.  If  you 
hadn't waked up, we should have left you to your idiotic dreams in the forest; you 
are no joke to carry even after weeks of short commons." 
There  was  nothing  now  to  be  done  but  to  tighten  the  belts  round  their  empty 
stomachs,  and  hoist  their  empty  sacks  and  packs,  and  trudge  along  the  track 
without any great hope of ever getting to the end before they lay down and died of 
starvation.  This  they  did  all  that  day,  going  very  slowly  and  wearily,  while 
Bombur  kept  on wailing  that  his  legs would  not  carry  him  and  that  he wanted  to 
lie down and sleep. 
"No you don't!" they said. "Let your legs take their share, we have carried you 
far enough." 
All  the same he suddenly refused  to go a step further and flung himself on  the 
ground.  "Go  on,  if  you  must,"  he  said.  "I'm  just  going  to  lie  here  and  sleep  and 
dream of food, if I can't get it any other way. I hope I never wake up again." 
At that very moment Balin, who was a little way ahead, called out: "What was 
that? I thought I saw a twinkle of light in the forest." 
They  all  looked,  and  a  longish  way  off,  it  seemed,  they  saw  a  red  twinkle  in 
the dark; then another and another sprang out beside it. Even Bombur got up, and 
they hurried along then, not caring if it was trolls or goblins. The light was in front 
of them and to the left of the path, and when at last they had drawn level with it, it 
seemed  plain  that  torches  and  fires were  burning  under  the  trees, but a good way 
off their track. 

####-"It  looks  as  if  my  dreams  were  coming  true,"  gasped  Bombur  puffing  up 
behind. He wanted to rush straight off into the wood after the lights. But the others 
remembered  only  too  well  the  warnings  of  the  wizard  and  of  Beorn.  "A  feast 
would be no good, if we never got back alive from it," said Thorin. 
"But  without  a  feast  we  shan't  remain  alive  much  longer  anyway,"  said 
Bombur, and Bilbo heartily agreed with him. They argued about it backwards and 
forwards for a long while, until they agreed at length to send out a couple of spies, 
to  creep  near  the  lights  and  find  out  more  about  them.  But  then  they  could  not 
agree  on  who  was  to  be  sent:  no  one  seemed  anxious  to  run  the  chance  of  being 
lost  and  never  finding  his  friends  again.  In  the  end,  in  spite  of  warnings,  hunger 
decided  them,  because  Bombur  kept  on  describing  all  the  good  things  that  were 
being eaten, according to his dream, in the woodland feast; so they all left the path 
and plunged into the forest together.  
After  a  good  deal  of  creeping  and  crawling  they  peered  round  the  trunks  and 
looked  into  a  clearing where  some  trees  had  been  felled  and  the  ground  levelled. 
There were many people there, elvish-looking folk, all dressed in green and brown 
and  sitting  on  sawn  rings  of  the  felled  trees  in  a  great  circle.  There was  a  fire  in 
their midst  and  there were  torches  fastened  to  some  of  the  trees  round  about;  but 
most splendid sight of all: they were eating and drinking and laughing merrily.  
The smell of the roast meats was so enchanting that, without waiting to consult 
one  another,  every  one  of  them  got  up  and  scrambled  forwards  into  the  ring with 
the  one  idea  of  begging  for  some  food.  No  sooner  had  the  first  stepped  into  the 
clearing  than all  the  lights went out as  if by magic. Somebody kicked the fire and 
it  went  up  in  rockets  of  glittering  sparks  and  vanished.  They  were  lost  in  a 
completely  lightless dark and  they could not even find one another, not for a  long 
time  at  any  rate.  After  blundering  frantically  in  the  gloom,  falling  over  logs, 
bumping  crash  into  trees,  and  shouting  and  calling  till  they  must  have  waked 
everything  in  the  forest  for miles,  at  last  they managed  to  gather  themselves  in  a 
bundle  and  count  themselves  by  touch.  By  that  time  they  had,  of  course,  quite 
forgotten  in what direction  the path  lay,  and  they were  all hopelessly  lost,  at  least 
till morning. 
There was nothing for it but to settle down for the night where they were; they 
did not  even dare  to  search on  the ground  for  scraps of  food  for  fear of becoming 
separated again. But they had not been lying long, and Bilbo was only just getting 
drowsy, when Dori, whose turn it was to watch first, said in a loud whisper: 
"The  lights  are  coming  out  again  over  there,  and  there  are more  than  ever  of 
them." 

####-Up they all jumped. There, sure enough, not far away were scores of twinkling 
lights, and  they heard  the voices and  the  laughter quite plainly. They crept slowly 
towards  them,  in  a  single  line,  each  touching  the  back  of  the  one  in  front. When 
they  got  near Thorin  said:  "No  rushing  forward  this  time! No  one  is  to  stir  from 
hiding till I say. I shall send Mr. Baggins alone first to talk to them. They won't be 
frightened  of  him-('What  about me  of  them?'  thought  Bilbo)-and any way  I hope 
they won't do anything nasty to him." 
When  they  got  to  the  edge  of  the  circle  of  lights  they  pushed  Bilbo  suddenly 
from behind. Before he had  time  to  slip on his  ring, he  stumbled  forward  into  the 
full blaze of the fire and torches. It was no good. Out went all the lights again and 
complete darkness fell. If  it had been difficult collecting  themselves before,  it was 
far  worse  this  time.  And  they  simply  could  not  find  the  hobbit.  Every  time  they 
counted  themselves  it  only  made  thirteen.  They  shouted  and  called:  "Bilbo 
Baggins!  Hobbit!  You  dratted  hobbit!  Hi!  hobbit,  confusticate  you,  where  are 
you?" and other things of that sort, but there was no answer.  
They were just giving up hope, when Dori stumbled across him by sheer luck. 
In the dark he fell over what he thought was a log, and he found it was the hobbit 
curled  up  fast  asleep.  It  took  a  deal  of  shaking  to  wake  him,  and  when  he  was 
awake he was not pleased at all. 
"I  was  having  such  a  lovely  dream,"  he  grumbled,  "all  about  having  a  most 
gorgeous dinner." 
"Good  heavens!  he  has  gone  like  Bombur,"  they  said.  "Don't  tell  us  about 
dreams. Dream-dinners aren't any good, and we can't share them." 
"They  are  the best  I  am  likely  to get  in  this beastly place," he muttered,  as he 
lay  down  beside  the  dwarves  and  tried  to  go  back  to  sleep  and  find  his  dream 
again.  But  that  was  not  the  last  of  the  lights  in  the  forest.  Later  when  the  night 
must  have  been  getting  old,  Kili  who  was  watching  then,  came  and  roused  them 
all again, saying: 
"There's a regular blaze of light begun not far away – hundreds of torches and 
many fires must have been lit suddenly and by magic. And hark to the singing and 
the harps!" 
After lying and listening for a while, they found they could not resist the desire 
to  go  nearer  and  try  once  more  to  get  help.  Up  they  got  again;  and  this  time  the 
result  was  disastrous.  The  feast  that  they  now  saw  was  greater  and  more 
magnificent  than before;  and  at  the head of  a  long  line of  feasters  sat  a woodland 
king  with  a  crown  of  leaves  upon  his  golden  hair,  very  much  as  Bombur  had 
described the figure in his dream. The elvish folk were passing bowls from hand to 

####-hand  and  across  the  fires,  and  some  were  harping  and many  were  singing.  Their 
gloaming  hair  was  twined  with  flowers;  green  and  white  gems  glinted  on  their 
collars and their belts; and their faces and their songs were filled with mirth. Loud 
and clear and fair were those songs, and out stepped Thorin into their midst. 
Dead  silence  fell  in  the middle of  a word. Out went  all  light. The  fires  leaped 
up  in  black  smokes.  Ashes  and  cinders  were  in  the  eyes  of  the  dwarves,  and  the 
wood  was  filled  again  with  their  clamour  and  their  cries.  Bilbo  found  himself 
running round and round (as he thought) and calling and calling: "Dori, Nori, Ori, 
Oin, Gloin, Fili, Kili, Bombur, Bifur, Bofur, Dwalin, Balin, Thorin Oakenshield," 
while people he could not see or  feel were doing  the same all  round him  (with an 
occasional "Bilbo!" thrown in). But the cries of the others got steadily further and 
fainter,  and  though  after  a while  it  seemed  to  him  they  changed  to  yells and cries 
for help  in  the  far distance, all noise at  last died  right away, and he was  left alone 
in complete silence and darkness. 
 
That was  one  of  his most miserable moments. But  he  soon made  up  his mind 
that  it was no good  trying  to do  anything  till  day came with some  little  light, and 
quite  useless  to  go  blundering  about  tiring  himself  out  with  no  hope  of  any 
breakfast to revive him. So he sat himself down with his back to a tree, and not for 
the  last  time  fell  to  thinking  of  his  far-distant  hobbit-hole  with  its  beautiful 
pantries. He was deep in thoughts of bacon and eggs and toast and butter when he 
felt something touch him. Something like a strong sticky string was against his left 
hand,  and when  he  tried  to move  he  found  that  his  legs were  already wrapped  in 
the same stuff, so that when he got up he fell over.  
Then  the great  spider, who had been busy  tying him up while he dozed, came 
from  behind  him  and  came  at  him.  He  could  only  see  the  things's  eyes,  but  he 
could  feel  its  hairy  legs  as  it  struggled  to wind  its  abominable  threads  round  and 
round him. It was lucky that he had come to his senses in time. Soon he would not 
have  been  able  to  move  at  all.  As  it  was,  he  had  a  desperate  fight  before  he  got 
free.  He  beat  the  creature  off  with  his  hands-it  was  trying  to  poison  him  to  keep 
him  quiet,  as  small  spiders  do  to  flies-until he  remembered his  sword  and drew  it 
out. Then the spider jumped back, and he had time to cut his legs loose. After that 
it was  his  turn  to  attack.  The  spider  evidently was  not  used  to  things  that carried 
such stings at  their sides, or  it would have hurried away quicker. Bilbo came at  it 
before  it  could  disappear  and  struck  it  with  his  sword  right  in  the  eyes.  Then  it 
went mad  and  leaped  and  danced  and  flung  out  its  legs  in  horrible  jerks, until he 

####-killed it with another stroke; and then he fell down and remembered nothing more 
for a long while. 
There was  the usual dim grey  light of  the  forest-day about him when he came 
to  his  senses.  The  spider  lay  dead  beside  him,  and  his  sword-blade  was  stained 
black.  Somehow  the  killing  of  the  giant  spider,  all  alone  by  himself  in  the  dark 
without  the  help  of  the  wizard  or  the  dwarves  or  of  anyone  else,  made  a  great 
difference  to Mr. Baggins. He  felt a different person, and much  fiercer and bolder 
in  spite  of  an  empty  stomach,  as  he wiped  his  sword  on  the  grass  and  put  it  back 
into its sheath. 
"I will give you a name," he said to it, "and I shall call you Sting." 
After  that he  set out  to  explore. The  forest was grim  and  silent, but obviously 
he  had  first  of  all  to  look  for  his  friends,  who  were  not  likely  to  be  very  far  off, 
unless they had been made prisoners by the elves (or worse things). 
Bilbo  felt  that  it was unsafe  to  shout,  and he  stood  a  long while wondering  in 
what direction the path lay,  and in what direction he should go first to look for the 
dwarves.  "O!  why  did  we  not  remember  Beorn's  advice,  and  Gandalf's!"  he 
lamented.  "What  a mess we  are  in  now! We!  I  only wish  it was we:  it  is  horrible 
being all alone." 
In the end he made as good a guess as he could at the direction from which the 
cries for help had come in the night – and by luck (he was born with a good share 
of  it) be guessed more or  less  right, as you will  see. Having made up his mind he 
crept  along  as  cleverly  as  he  could.  Hobbits  are  clever  at quietness,  especially  in 
woods,  as  1.  have  already  told  you;  also  Bilbo  had  slipped  on  his  ring  before  he 
started. That is why the spiders neither saw nor heard him coming. 
He had picked his way stealthily 'for some distance, when he noticed a place of 
dense  black  shadow  ahead  of  him  black  even  for  that  forest,  like  a  patch  of 
midnight  that had never been cleared away. As he drew nearer, he saw  that  it was 
made  by  spider-webs one behind  and over  and  tangled with  another. Suddenly he 
saw,  too,  that  there  were  spiders  huge  and  horrible  sitting  in  the  branches  above 
him,  and  ring  or  no  ring  he  trembled  with  fear  lest  they  should  discover  him. 
Standing behind a tree he watched a group of them for some time, and then in the 
silence  and  stillness  of  the  wood  he  realised  that  these  loathsome  creatures  were 
speaking one to another. Their voices were a sort of thin creaking and hissing, but 
he could make out many of  the words  that  they said. They were  talking about  the 
dwarves! 
"It was  a  sharp  struggle, but worth  it,"  said one.  "What nasty  thick  skins  they 
have to be sure, but I'll wager there is good juice inside." 

####-"Aye, they'll make fine eating, when they've hung a bit," said another.  
"Don't  hang  'em  too  long,"  said  a  third.  "They're  not  as  fat  as  they might  be. 
Been feeding none too well of late, I should guess." 
"Kill'em, I say," hissed a fourth; "kill 'em now and hang 'em dead for a while." 
"They're dead now, I'll warrant," said the first. 
"That they are not. I saw one a-struggling just now. Just coming round again, I 
should say, after a bee-autiful sleep. I'll show you." 
With that one of the fat spiders ran along a rope, till it came to a dozen bundles 
hanging  in  a  row  from  a  high  branch.  Bilbo  was  horrified,  now  that  he  noticed 
them for the first time dangling in the shadows, to see a dwarvish foot sticking out 
of  the bottoms of some of  the bundles, or here and  there  the  tip of a nose, or a bit 
of beard or of a hood. 
To the fattest of these bundles the spider went--"It is poor old Bombur, I'll bet," 
thought Bilbo  –  and  nipped  hard  at  the  nose  that  stuck  out. There was  a muffled 
yelp  inside,  and  a  toe  shot  up  and  kicked  the  spider  straight  and  hard. There was 
life  in  Bombur  still.  There  was  a  noise  like  the  kicking  of  a  flabby  football,  and 
the  enraged spider  fell off  the branch, only catching  itself with  its own  thread  just 
in time. 
The  others  laughed.  "You  were  quite  right,"  they  said,  "the  meat's  alive  and 
kicking!"                        " 
"I'll  soon  put  an  end  to  that,"  hissed  the  angry  spider  climbing  back  onto  the 
branch. 
Bilbo  saw  that  the moment  had  come  when  he must  do  something.  He  could 
not  get  up  at  the  brutes  and  he  had  nothing  to  shoot  with;  but  looking  about  he 
saw  that  in  this place  there were many  stones  lying  in what appeared  to be  a now 
dry little watercourse. Bilbo was a pretty fair shot with a stone, and it did not take 
him long to find a nice smooth egg-shaped one that fitted his hand cosily.  
As  a  boy  he  used  to  practise  throwing  stones  at  things,  until  rabbits  and 
squirrels,  and even birds, got out of his way as quick as  lightning  if  they saw him 
stoop;  and  even  grownup  he  had  still  spent  a  deal  of  his  time  at  quoits,  dart-
throwing,  shooting  at  the  wand,  bowls,  ninepins  and  other  quiet  games  of  the 
aiming  and  throwing  sort-indeed  he  could  do  lots  of  things,  besides  blowing 
smoke-rings, asking riddles and cooking, that I haven't had time to tell you about. 
There  is  no  time  now.  While  he  was  picking  up  stones,  the  spider  had  reached 
Bombur,  and  soon  he  would  have  been  dead.  At  that  moment  Bilbo  threw.  The 
stone struck the spider plunk on the head, and it dropped senseless off the tree, flop 
to the ground, with all its legs curled up. 

####-The  next  stone  went  whizzing  through  a  big  web,  snapping  its  cords,  and 
taking off the spider sitting in the middle of it, whack, dead. After that there was a 
deal  of  commotion  in  the  spider-colony,  and  they  forgot  the  dwarves  for  a  bit,  I 
can  tell  you.  They  could  not  see Bilbo,  but  they  could make  a  good  guess  at  the 
direction  from  which  the  stones  were  coming.  As  quick  as  lightning  they  came 
running  and  swinging  towards  the  hobbit,  flinging  out  their  long  threads  in  all 
directions,  till  the  air  seemed  full  of waving  snares. Bilbo,  however,  soon  slipped 
away to a different place. The idea came to him to lead the furious spiders further 
and further away from the dwarves, if he could; to make them curious, excited and 
angry  all  at  once. When  about  fifty  had  gone  off  to  the  place where  he  had  stood 
before, he threw some more stones at these, and at others that had stopped behind; 
then dancing among  the  trees he began  to  sing a  song  to  infuriate  them and bring 
them all after him, and also to let the dwarves hear his voice. 
This is what he sang: 
 

Old fat spider spinning in a tree! 
Old fat spider can't see me! 
Attercop! Attercop! 
Won't you stop, 
Stop your spinning and look for me! 
 
Old Tomnoddy, all big body,  
Old Tomnoddy can't spy me! 
Attercop! Attercop! 
Down you drop! 
You'll never catch me up your tree! 

 
Not very good perhaps, but then you must remember that he had to make it up 
himself, on  the  spur of  a very  awkward moment.  It did what he wanted  any way. 
As he  sang he  threw  some more  stones  and  stamped. Practically  all  the  spiders  in 
the  place  came  after  him:  some  dropped  to  the  ground,  others  raced  along  the 
branches, swung  from  tree  to  tree, or cast new  ropes across  the dark spaces. They 
made  for his noise  far quicker  than he had expected. They were  frightfully angry. 
Quite  apart  from  the  stones  no  spider  has  ever  liked  being  called  Attercop,  and 
Tomnoddy of course is insulting to anybody.  
Off  Bilbo  scuttled  to  a  fresh  place,  but  several  of  the  spiders  had  run  now  to 
different points in the glade where they lived, and were busy spinning webs across 
all  the  spaces  between  the  tree-stems.  Very  soon  the  hobbit would be  caught  in  a 

####-thick fence of them all round him-that at least was the spiders' idea. Standing now 
in  the  middle  of  the  hunting  and  spinning  insects  Bilbo  plucked  up  his  courage 
and began a new song: 
 

####-Lazy Lob and crazy Cob 
are weaving webs to wind me. 
I am far more sweet than other meat, 
but still they cannot find me! 
 
Here am I, naughty little fly; 
you are fat and lazy.  
You cannot trap me, though you try, 
in your cobwebs crazy.  

 
With  that  he  turned  and  found  that  the  last  space  between  two  tall  trees  had 
been closed with a web-but luckily not a proper web, only great strands of double-
thick  spider-rope  run  hastily  backwards  and  forwards  from  trunk  to  trunk.  Out 
came his little' sword. He slashed the threads to pieces and went off singing. 
The spiders saw the sword, though I don't suppose they knew what it was, and 
at once the whole lot of them came hurrying after the hobbit along the ground and 
the branches, hairy legs waving, nippers and spinners snapping, eyes popping, full 
of froth and rage. They followed him into the forest until Bilbo had gone as far as 
he dared. 
Then quieter than a mouse he stole back. He had precious little time, he knew, 
before  the  spiders were disgusted and came back  to  their  trees where  the dwarves 
were hung. In the meanwhile he had to rescue them. The worst part of the job was 
getting up on to the long branch where the bundles were dangling. I don't suppose 
he would  have managed  it,  if  a  spider  had  not  luckily  left  a  rope  hanging  down; 
with  its  help,  though  it  stuck  to  his  hand  and  hurt  him,  he  scrambled  up-only  to 
meet  an old  slow wicked  fat-bodied spider who had remained behind to guard the 
prisoners, and had been busy pinching them to see which was the juiciest to eat. It 
had  thought of starting  the feast while  the others were away, but Mr. Baggins was 
in  a  hurry,  and  before  the  spider  knew  what  was  happening  it  felt  his  sting  and 
rolled off  the branch dead. Bilbo's next  job was  to  loose  a dwarf. What was he  to 
do?  If  he  cut  the  string  which  hung  him  up,  the  wretched  dwarf  would  tumble 
thump to the ground a good way below. Wriggling along the branch (which made 
all the poor dwarves dance and dangle like ripe fruit) he reached the first bundle. 
"Fili  or  Kili,"  he  thought  by  the  tip  of  a  blue  hood  sticking  out  at  the  top. 
"Most  likely Fili," he  thought by  the  tip of a  long nose poking out of  the winding 
threads. He managed by  leaning over  to cut most of  the strong sticky  threads  that 
bound  him  round,  and  then,  sure  enough, with  a  kick  and  a  struggle most  of  Fili 
emerged.  I  am  afraid  Bilbo  actually  laughed  at  the  sight  of  him  jerking  his  stiff 

####-arms and  legs as he danced on  the  spider-string under his armpits, just like one of 
those funny toys bobbing on a wire. 
Somehow  or  other  Fili  was  got  on  to  the  branch,  and  then  he  did  his  best  to 
help  the hobbit,  although he was  feeling very  sick  and  ill  from  spider-poison, and 
from  hanging  most  of  the  night  and  the  next  day  wound  round  and  round  with 
only his nose to breathe through. It took him ages to get the beastly stuff out of his 
eyes and eyebrows, and as for his beard, he had to cut most of it off. Well, between 
them  they started  to haul up  first one dwarf and  then another and slash  them  free. 
None  of  them were  better  off  than  Fili,  and  some  of  them were worse.  Some  had 
hardly  been  able  to breathe  at  all  (long noses  are  sometimes useful you  see),  and 
some had been more poisoned. 
In  this  way  they  rescued  Kili,  Bifur,  Bofur,  Don  and  Nori.  Poor  old  Bombur 
was  so  exhausted-he was  the  fattest  and  had  been  constantly  pinched  and  poked-
that  he  just  rolled off  the branch  and  fell plop on  to  the ground,  fortunately on  to 
leaves,  and  lay  there.  But  there were  still  five  dwarves  hanging  at  the  end  of  the 
branch  when  the  spiders  began  to  come  back,  more  full  of  rage  than  ever.  Bilbo 
immediately  went  to  the  end  of  the  branch  nearest  the  tree-trunk  and  kept  back 
those that crawled up. He had taken off his ring when he rescued Fili and forgotten 
to put it on again, so now they all began to splutter and hiss: 
"Now  we  see  you,  you  nasty  little  creature!  We  will  eat  you  and  leave  your 
bones and skin hanging on a tree. Ugh! he's got a sting has he? Well, we'll get him 
all the same, and then we'll hang him head downwards for a day or two." 
While  this  was  going  on,  the  other  dwarves  were  working  at  the  rest  of  the 
captives,  and  cutting  at  the  threads  with  their  knives.  Soon  all  would  be  free, 
though  it  was  not  clear  what  would  happen  after  that.  The  spiders  had  caught 
them  pretty  easily  the  night  before,  but  that  had  been  unawares  and  in  the  dark. 
This time there looked like being a horrible battle. 
Suddenly  Bilbo  noticed  that  some  of  the  spiders  had  gathered  round  old 
Bombur on the floor, and had tied him up again and were dragging him away. He 
gave  a  shout  and  slashed  at  the  spiders  in  front  of  him.  They  quickly  gave way, 
and  he  scrambled  and  fell  down  the  tree  right  into  the  middle  of  those  on  the 
ground. His  little sword was something new  in  the way of stings for  them. How  it 
darted  to  and  fro!  It  shone with  delight  as  he  stabbed  at  them. Half  a  dozen were 
killed before the rest drew off and left Bombur to Bilbo. 
"Come  down! Come  down!"  he  shouted  to  the  dwarves  on  the  branch.  "Don't 
stay up  there and be netted!" For he saw spiders swarming up all  the neighboring 
trees, and crawling along the boughs above the heads of the dwarves. 

####-Down the dwarves scrambled or jumped or dropped, eleven all in a heap, most 
of  them  very  shaky  and  little  use  on  their  legs. There  they were  at  last,  twelve  of 
them counting poor old Bombur, who was being propped up on either  side by his 
cousin Bifur, and his brother Bofur; and Bilbo was dancing about and waving his 
Sting;  and  hundreds  of  angry  spiders were  goggling  at  them  all  round  and  about 
and above. It looked pretty hopeless. 
Then  the  battle  began. Some  of  the  dwarves  had  knives,  and some had sticks, 
and  all  of  them  could  get  at  stones;  and  Bilbo  had  his  elvish  dagger.  Again  and 
again  the spiders were beaten off, and many of  them were killed. But  it could not 
go  on  for  long. Bilbo was  nearly  tired  out;  only  four  of  the  dwarves were  able to 
stand firmly, and soon they would all be overpowered like weary flies. Already the 
spiders were beginning to weave their webs all round them again from tree to tree. 
In the end Bilbo could think of no plan except to let the dwarves into the secret of 
his ring. He was rather sorry about it, but it could not be helped. 
"I  am  going  to  disappear,"  he  said.  "I  shall  draw  the  spiders  off,  if  I  can;  and 
you must keep  together  and make  in  the opposite direction. To  the  left  there,  that 
is more or less the way towards the place where we last saw the elf-fires." 
It was difficult to get them to understand, what with their dizzy heads, and the 
shouts, and the whacking of sticks and the throwing of stones; but at last Bilbo felt 
he  could  delay  no  longer-the  spiders  were  drawing  their  circle  ever  closer.  He 
suddenly  slipped  on  his  ring,  and  to  the  great  astonishment  of  the  dwarves  he 
vanished. 
Soon  there  came  the  sound  of  "Lazy  Lob"  and  "Attercop"  from  among  the 
trees  away  on  the  right.  That  upset  the  spiders  greatly. They  stopped  advancing, 
and  some,  went  off  in  the  direction  of  the  voice.  "Attercop" made  them  so  angry 
that  they  lost  their wits. Then Balin, who had grasped Bilbo's plan better  than  the 
rest, led an attack. The dwarves huddled together in a knot, and sending a shower 
of  stones  they  drove  at  the  spiders  on  the  left,  and  burst  through  the  ring.  Away 
behind them now the shouting and singing suddenly stopped. 
Hoping  desperately  that Bilbo  had  not  been  caught  the  dwarves went  on. Not 
fast enough, though. They were sick and weary, and they could not go much better 
than a hobble and a wobble, though many of the spiders were close behind. Every 
now  and  then  they  had  to  turn  and  fight  the  creatures  that were  overtaking  them 
and  already  some  spiders  were  in  the  trees  above  them  and  throwing  down  their 
long clinging threads. 
Things  were  looking  pretty  bad  again,  when  suddenly  Bilbo  appeared  and 
charged into the astonished spiders unexpectedly from the side. 

####-"Go  on!  Go  on!"  he  shouted.  "I  will  do  the  stinging!"  And  he did. He darted 
backwards  and  forwards,  slashing  at  spider-threads,  hacking  at  their  legs,  and 
stabbing  at  their  fat  bodies  if  they  came  too  near.  The  spiders  swelled  with  rage, 
and  spluttered  and  frothed,  and  hissed  out  horrible  curses;  but  they  had  become 
mortally afraid of Sting, and dared not come very near, now that it had come back. 
So curse as  they would,  their prey moved slowly but steadily away. It was a most 
terrible business, and seemed to take hours. But at last, just when Bilbo felt that he 
could  not  lift  his  hand  for  a  single  stroke  more,  the  spiders  suddenly  gave  it  up, 
and followed them no more, but went back disappointed to their dark colony.  
The  dwarves  then  noticed  that  they  had  come  to  the  edge  of  a  ring where  elf-
fires  had  been.  Whether  it  was  one  of  those  they  had  seen  the  night  before,  they 
could  not  tell. But  it  seemed  that  some  good magic  lingered  in  such  spots, which 
the spiders did not like. At any rate here the light was greener, and the boughs less 
thick and threatening, and they had a chance to rest and draw breath. 
There they lay for some time, puffing and panting. put very soon they began to 
ask questions. They had to have the whole vanishing business carefully explained, 
and  the  finding  of  the  ring  interested  them  so  much  that  for  a  while  they  forgot 
their own troubles. Balin in particular insisted on having the Gollum story, riddles 
and  all,  told  all  over  again, with  the  ring  in  its  proper  place. But  after  a  time  the 
light  began  to  fail,  and  then  other  questions  were  asked.  Where  were  they,  and 
where was their path, and where was there any food, and what were they going to 
do  next?  These  questions  they  asked  over  and  over  again,  and  it  was  from  little 
Bilbo  that  they seemed  to expect  to get  the answers. From which you can see  that 
they had changed their opinion of Mr. Baggins very much, and had begun to have 
a  great  respect  for  him  (as  Gandalf  had  said  they  would).  Indeed  they  really 
expected  him  to  think  of  some  wonderful  plan  for  helping  them,  and  were  not 
merely  grumbling.  They  knew  only  too  well  that  they  would  soon  all  have  been 
dead, if it had not been for the hobbit; and they thanked him many times. Some of 
them even got up and bowed right to the ground before him, though they fell over 
with  the  effort,  and  could  not  get  on  their  legs  again  for  some  time. Knowing  the 
truth about  the vanishing did not  lessen  their opinion of Bilbo at all;  for  they saw 
that  he  had  some  wits,  as  well  as  luck  and  a  magic  ring-and  all  three  are  very 
useful possessions. In fact they praised him so much that Bilbo began to feel there 
really  was  something  of  a  bold  adventurer  about  himself  after  all,  though  he  I 
would have felt a lot bolder still, if there had been anything to eat. 
But there was nothing, nothing at all; and none of them Were fit to go and look 
for  anything,  or  to  search  for  the  lost  path.  The  lost  path!  No  other  idea  would 

####-come into Bilbo's tired head. He just sat staring in front of him at the endless trees; 
and  after  a while  they  all  fell  silent  again. All  except Balin. Long  after  the others 
had  stopped  talking  and  shut  their  eyes,  he  kept  on  muttering  and  chuckling  to 
himself. 
"Gollum! Well I'm blest! So that's how he sneaked past me is it? Now I know! 
Just  crept  quietly  along  did  you,  Mr.  Baggins?  Buttons  all  over  the  doorstep? 
Good  old  Bilbo-Bilbo-Bilbo-bo-bo-bo–"  And  then  he  fell  asleep,  and  there  was 
complete silence for a long time. 
All  of  a  sudden Dwalin  opened  an  eye,  and  looked  round  at  them.  "Where  is 
Thorin?"  he  asked.  It  was  a  terrible  shock.  Of  course  there  were  only  thirteen of 
them,  twelve dwarves and  the hobbit. Where  indeed was Thorin? They wondered 
what  evil  fate  had  befallen  him,  magic  or  dark  monsters;  and  shuddered  as  they 
lay  lost  in  the  forest. There  they dropped off one by one  into uncomfortable  sleep 
full  of  horrible  dreams,  as  evening wore  to  black  night;  and  there we must  leave 
them for the present, too sick and weary to set guards or take turns watching. 
Thorin  had  been  caught  much  faster  than  they  had.  You  remember  Bilbo 
falling  like  a  log  into  sleep,  as  he  stepped  into  a  circle  of  light?  The  next  time  it 
had  been  Thorin  who  stepped  forward,  and  as  the  lights  went  out  he  fell  like  a 
stone  enchanted.  All  the  noise  of  the  dwarves  lost  in  the  night,  their  cries  as  the 
spiders caught them and bound them, and all the sounds of the battle next day, had 
passed over him unheard. Then the Wood-elves had come to him, and bound him, 
and carried him away. The feasting people were Wood-elves, of course. These are 
not wicked folk. If they have a fault it is distrust of strangers. Though their magic 
was strong, even in those days they were wary. They differed from the High Elves 
of  the West,  and were more  dangerous  and  less wise.  For most  of  them  (together 
with  their  scattered  relations  in  the hills  and mountains) were  descended from the 
ancient  tribes  that never went  to Faerie  in  the West. There  the Light-elves and the 
Deep-elves  and  the  Sea-elves  went  and  lived  for  ages,  and  grew  fairer  and  wiser 
and more learned, and invented their magic and their cunning craft, in the making 
of  beautiful  and marvellous  things,  before  some  came  back  into  the Wide World. 
In  the Wide World  the Wood-elves  lingered  in  the  twilight of  our Sun  and Moon 
but  loved  best  the  stars;  and  they  wandered  in  the  great  forests  that  grew  tall  in 
lands  that  are  now  lost.  They  dwelt  most  often  by  the  edges  of  the  woods,  from 
which they could escape at times to hunt, or to ride and run over the open lands by 
moonlight or starlight; and after the coming of Men they took ever more and more 
to  the  gloaming  and  the  dusk. Still  elves  they were  and  remain,  and  that  is Good 
People. 

####-In  a  great  cave  some  miles  within  the  edge  of  Mirkwood  on  its  eastern  side 
there  lived  at  this  time  their  greatest  king. Before  his  huge  doors  of  stone  a  river 
ran  out  of  the  heights  of  the  forest  and  flowed on  and out  into  the marshes  at  the 
feet of the high wooded lands. This great cave, from which countless smaller ones 
opened  out  on  every  side,  wound  far  underground  and  had  many  passages  and 
wide  halls;  but  it was  lighter  and more wholesome  than  any  goblin-dwelling, and 
neither so deep nor so dangerous. In fact the subjects of the king mostly lived and 
hunted  in  the  open  woods,  and  had  houses  or  huts  on  the  ground  and  in  the 
branches. The  beeches were  their  favourite  trees. The  king's  cave  was his palace, 
and  the  strong  place  of  his  treasure,  and  the  fortress  of  his  people  against  their 
enemies. 
It was  also  the  dungeon  of  his  prisoners.  So  to  the  cave  they  dragged Thorin-
not  too  gently,  for  they  did  not  love  dwarves,  and  thought  he  was  an  enemy.  In 
ancient days  they had had wars with some of  the dwarves, whom  they accused of 
stealing  their  treasure.  It  is  only  fair  to  say  that  the  dwarves  gave  a  different 
account, and said that they only took what was their due, for the elf-king had bar- 
gained with  them  to  shape  his  raw  gold  and  silver,  and  had  afterwards  refused  to 
give  them  their  pay.  If  the  elf-king had  a weakness  it was  for  treasure,  especially 
for  silver  and  white  gems;  and  though  his  hoard  was  rich,  he  was  ever  eager  for 
more, since he  had not yet  as great  a  treasure  as other  elf-lords of old. His people 
neither mined nor worked metals or jewels, nor did they bother much with trade or 
with  tilling  the  earth.  All  this  was  well  known  to  every  dwarf,  though  Thorin's 
family had had nothing  to do with the old quarrel I have spoken of. Consequently 
Thorin was angry at their treatment of him, when they took their spell off him and 
he came  to his senses; and also he was determined  that no word of gold or  jewels 
should be dragged out of him. 
The  king  looked  sternly  on  Thorin,  when  he  was  brought  before  him,  and 
asked him many questions. But Thorin would only say that he was starving. 
"Why  did  you  and  your  folk  three  times  try  to  attack  my  people  at  their 
merrymaking?" asked the king. 
"We  did  not  attack  them,"  answered  Thorin;  "we  came  to  beg,  because  we 
were starving." 
"Where are your friends now, and what are they doing?" 
"I don't know, but I expect starving in the forest." 
"What were you doing in the forest?" 
"Looking for food and drink, because we were starving." 
"But what brought you into the forest at all?" asked the king angrily.  

####-At that Thorin shut his mouth and would not say another word. 
"Very well!"  said  the  king.  "Take  him  away  and  keep  him  safe,  until  he  feels 
inclined to tell the truth, even if he waits a hundred years.'" 
Then the elves put thongs on him, and shut him in one of the inmost caves with 
strong wooden doors, and left him. They gave him food and drink, plenty of both, 
if  not  very  fine;  for  Wood-elves  were  not  goblins,  and  were  reasonably  well-
behaved even  to  their worst enemies, when  they captured  them. The giant  spiders 
were the only living things that they had no mercy upon. 
There  in  the  king's  dungeon  poor  Thorin  lay;  and  after  he  had  got  over  his 
thankfulness  for bread  and meat and water, he began to wonder what had become 
of  his  unfortunate  friends.  It  was  not  very  long  before  he  discovered;  but  that 
belongs  to  the  next  chapter  and  the  beginning  of  another  adventure  in  which  the 
hobbit again showed his usefulness. 
 

####-<h4>Chapter 9 </h4> <br> <br>

Barrels Out of Bond 

 
The day  after  the battle with  the  spiders Bilbo  and  the dwarves made one  last 
despairing effort  to find a way out before  they died of hunger and  thirst. They got 
up  and  staggered  on  in  the  direction  which  eight  out  of  the  thirteen  of  them 
guessed to be the one in which the path lay; but they never found out if they were 
right.  Such  day  as  there  ever  was  in  the  forest  was  fading  once  more  into  the 
blackness of night, when  suddenly out  sprang  the  light of many  torches  all  round 
them,  like  hundreds  of  red  stars.  Out  leaped  Wood-elves  with  their  bows  and 
spears and called the dwarves to halt. 
There  was  no  thought  of  a  fight.  Even  if  the  dwarves  had  not  been  in  such  a 
state  that  they  were  actually  glad  to  be  captured,  their  small  knives,  the  only 
weapons  they had, would have been of no use against  the arrows of  the elves  that 
could  hit  a  bird's  eye  in  the  dark. So  they  simply  stopped  dead  and  sat  down  and 
waited-all except Bilbo, who popped on his ring and slipped quickly to one side. 
That  is why, when  the  elves bound  the dwarves  in  a  long  line, one behind  the 
other,  and  counted  them,  they  never  found  or  counted  the  hobbit.  Nor  did  they 
hear  or  feel  him  trotting  along  well  behind  their  torch-light  as  they  led  off  their 
prisoners  into  the  forest.  Each  dwarf  was  blindfold,  but  that  did  not  make  much 
difference,  for  even Bilbo with  the  use  of  his  eyes  could  not  see where  they were 
going,  and  neither  he  nor  the  others  knew  where  they  had  started  from  anyway. 
Bilbo  had  all  he  could  do  to  keep  up with  the  torches,  for  the  elves were making 
the dwarves go  as  fast  as  ever  they  could,  sick  and weary  as  they were. The king 
had ordered them to make haste. Suddenly the torches stopped, and the hobbit had 
just  time  to  catch  them  up  before  they  began  to  cross  the  bridge.  This  was  the 
bridge  that  led  across  the  river  to  the  king's  doors.  The  water  flowed  dark  and 
swift and strong beneath; and at the far end were gates before the mouth of a huge 
cave  that  ran  into  the  side  of  a  steep  slope  covered  with  trees.  There  the  great 
beeches came right down to the bank, till their feet were in the stream. Across this 
bridge the elves thrust their prisoners, but Bilbo hesitated in the rear. He did not at 
all  like  the  look  of  the  cavern-mouth  and  he  only made  up  his mind  not  to desert 
his friends just in time to scuttle over at the heels of the fast elves, before the great 
gates of the king closed behind them with a clang. 
Inside  the  passages  were  lit  with  red  torch-light,  and  the  elf-guards  sang  as 
they marched along  the  twisting, crossing, and echoing paths. These were not like 

####-those  of  the  goblin-cities:  they  were  smaller,  less  deep  underground,  and  filled 
with  a  cleaner  air.  In  a  great  hall with  pillars  hewn  out  of  the  living  stone  sat  the 
Elvenking on a chair of carven wood. On his head was a crown of berries and red 
leaves,  for  the  autumn  was  come  again.  In  the  spring  he  wore  a  crown  of 
woodland flowers. In his hand he held a carven staff of oak. 
The prisoners were brought before him; and though he looked grimly at them, 
he  told  his  men  to  unbind  them,  for  they  were  ragged  and  weary.  "Besides  they 
need no ropes in here," said he. "There is no escape from my magic doors for those 
who are once brought inside." 
Long and searchingly he questioned the dwarves about their doings, and where 
they were going to, and where they were coming from; but he got little more news 
out  of  them  than  out  of  Thorin.  They  were  surly  and  angry  and  did  not  even 
pretend to be polite. 
"What  have  we  done,  O  king?"  said  Balin,  who  was  the  eldest  left.  "Is  it  a 
crime  to  be  lost  in  the  forest,  to  be  hungry  and  thirsty,  to  be  trapped  by  spiders? 
Are  the  spiders your  tame beasts or your pets,  if killing  them makes you  angry?" 
Such a question of course made the king angrier than ever, and he answered: "It is 
a crime  to wander  in my  realm without  leave. Do you  forget  that you were  in my 
kingdom,  using  the  road  that  my  people  made?  Did  you  not  three  times  pursue 
and  trouble  my  people  in  the  forest  and  '  rouse  the  spiders  with  your  riot  and 
clamour?  After  all  the  disturbance  you  have  made  I  have  a  right  to  know  what 
brings you here, and if you will not tell me now, I will keep you all in prison until 
you have learned sense and manners!" 
Then he ordered  the dwarves  each  to be put  in  a  separate  cell  and  to be given 
food and drink, but not  to be allowed  to pass  the doors of  their  little prisons, until 
one at  least of  them was willing  to  tell him all he wanted  to know. But be did not 
tell  them  that  Thorin  was  also  a  prisoner  with  him.  It  was  Bilbo  who  found  that 
out. 
 
Poor  Mr.  Baggins  –  it  was  a  weary  long  time  that  he  lived  in  that  place  all 
alone,  and  always  in  hiding,  never  daring  to  take  off  his  ring,  hardly  daring  to 
sleep,  even  tucked  away  in  the  darkest  and  remotest  comers  he  could  find.  For 
something  to  do  he  took  to wandering  about  the  Elven-king's palace. Magic shut 
the  gates,  but  be  could  sometimes  get  out,  if  he  was  quick.  Companies  of  the 
Wood-elves,  sometimes with  the  king  at  their  head, would  from  time  to  time  ride 
out  to hunt, or  to other business  in  the woods and in the lands to the East. Then if 
Bilbo  was  very  nimble,  he  could  slip  out  just  behind  them;  though  it  was  a 

####-dangerous  thing  to do. More  than once he was nearly caught  in  the doors, as  they 
clashed  together  when  the  last  elf  passed;  yet  he  did  not  dare  to  march  among 
them  because  of  his  shadow  (altogether  thin  and wobbly  as  it was  in  torch-light), 
or  for  fear  of  being  bumped  into  and  discovered. And when  he  did  go  out, which 
was  not  very  often,  he  did  no  good.  He  did  not  wish  to  desert  the  dwarves, and 
indeed he did not know where in the world to go without them. He could not keep 
up  with  the  hunting  elves  all  the  time  they  were  out,  so  he  never  discovered  the 
ways  out  of  the wood,  and was  left  to wander miserably  in  the  forest,  terrified  of 
losing  himself,  until  a  chance  came  of  returning. He was  hungry  too  outside,  for 
he was  no  hunter;  but  inside  the  caves  he  could  pick  up  a  living  of  some  sort  by 
stealing  food  from  store  or  table  when  no  one  was  at  hand.  "I  am  like  a  burglar 
that  can't  get  away,  but must  go  on miserably  burgling  the  same  house  day  after 
day,"  he  thought.  "This  is  the  dreariest  and  dullest  part  of  all  this  wretched, 
tiresome,  uncomfortable  adventure!  I  wish  I  was  back  in  my  hobbit-hole  by my 
own warm fireside with the lamp shining!" He often wished, too, that he could get 
a message for help sent to the wizard, but that of course was quite impossible; and 
he soon  realized  that  if anything was  to be done,  it would have  to be done by Mr. 
Baggins, alone and unaided. 
Eventually,  after  a week  or  two  of  this  sneaking  sort  of  life,  by watching  and 
following  the  guards  and  taking  what  chances  he  could,  he  managed  to  find  out 
where each dwarf was kept. He found all their twelve cells in different parts of the 
palace,  and  after  a  time  he  got  to  know  his  way  about  very  well.  What  was  his 
surprise one day to overhear some of the guards talking and to learn that there was 
another dwarf in prison too, in a specially deep dark place. He guessed at once, of 
course,  that  that was  Thorin;  and  after  a while he  found  that his guess was  right. 
At  last  after  many  difficulties  he  managed  to  find  the  place  when  no  one  was 
about, and to have a word with the chief of the dwarves. Thorin was too wretched 
to  be  angry  any  longer  at  his  misfortunes,  and  was  even  beginning  to  think  of 
telling the king all about his treasure and his quest (which shows how low-spirited 
he had become), when he heard Bilbo's little voice at his keyhole. He could hardly 
believe  his  ears.  Soon  however  he  made  up  his  mind  that  he  could  not  be 
mistaken, and he came  to  the door and had a  long whispered  talk with  the hobbit 
on the other side. 
So  it was  that Bilbo was  able  to  take  secretly Thorin's message  to  each of  the 
other  imprisoned  dwarves,  telling  them  that  Thorin  their  chief was  also  in prison 
close  at  hand,  and  that  no  one was  to  reveal  their  errand  to  the  long,  not  yet,  not 
before  Thorin  gave  the  word.  For  Thorin  had  taken  heart  again  hearing  how  the 

####-hobbit  had  rescued  his  companions  from  the  spiders,  and  was  determined  once 
more  not  to  ransom  himself  with  promises  to  the  king  of  a  share  in  the  treasure, 
until  all  hope  of  escaping  in  any  other  way  had  disappeared;  until  in  fact  the 
remarkable Mr. Invisible Baggins (of whom he began to have a very high opinion 
indeed) had altogether failed to think of something clever.  
The  other  dwarves  quite  agreed when  they  got  the message. They  all  thought 
their  own  shares  in  the  treasure  (which  they  quite  regarded  as  theirs,  in  spite  of 
their plight  and  the  still unconquered dragon) would  suffer  seriously if the Wood-
elves  claimed  part  of  it,  and  they  all  trusted  Bilbo.  Just  what  Gandalf  had  said 
would  happen,  you  see.  Perhaps  that  war  part  of  his  reason  for  going  off  and 
leaving them. 
Bilbo,  however,  did  not  feel  nearly  so  hopeful  as  they  did.  He  did  not  like 
being depended on by everyone, and he wished he had the wizard at hand. But that 
was no use: probably all the dark distance of Mirkwood lay between them. He sat 
and  thought  and  thought,  until  his  head  nearly  burst,  but  no  bright  idea  would 
come. One  invisible  ring was  a  very  fine  thing,  but  it was  not much  good  among 
fourteen. But of course, as you have guessed, he did  rescue his  friends  in  the end, 
and  this  is  how  it  happened.  One  day,  nosing  and  wandering  about.  Bilbo 
discovered  a  very  interesting  thing:  the  great  gates  were  not  the  only  entrance  to 
the  caves.  A  stream  flowed  under  part  of  the  lowest  regions  of  the  palace,  and 
joined the Forest River some way further to the east, beyond the steep slope out of 
which  the  main  mouth  opened.  Where  this  underground watercourse  came  forth 
from the hillside there was a water-gate. There the rocky roof came down close to 
the surface of the stream, and from it a portcullis could be dropped right to the bed 
of  the  river  to  prevent  anyone  coming  in  or  out  that way. But  the  portcullis was 
often open,  for a good deal of  traffic went out and  in by  the water-gate. If anyone 
had come in that way, he would have found himself in a dark rough tunnel leading 
deep into the heart of the hill; but at one point where it  passed under the caves the 
roof  had  been  cut  away  and  covered  with  great  oaken  trapdoors.  These  opened 
upwards  into  the  king's  cellars.  There  stood  barrels,  and  barrels,  and  barrels;  for 
the Wood-elves, and especially their king, were very fond of wine, though no vines 
grew in those parts. The wine, and other goods, were brought from far away, from 
their kinsfolk in the South, or from the vineyards of Men in distant lands. 
Hiding  behind  one  of  the  largest  barrels  Bilbo  discovered  the  trapdoors  and 
their  use,  and  lurking  there,  listening  to  the  talk of  the king's  servants, he  learned 
how the wine and other goods came up the rivers, or over land, to the Long Lake. 
It  seemed  a  town of Men  still  throve  there, built out on bridges  far  into  the water 

####-as  a  protection  against  enemies  of  all  sorts,  and  especially  against  the  dragon  of 
the  Mountain.  From  Lake-town  the  barrels  were  brought  up  the  Forest  River. 
Often they were just tied together like big rafts and poled or rowed up the stream; 
sometimes they were loaded on to flat boats. 
When  the  barrels  were  empty  the  elves  cast  them  through  the  trapdoors, 
opened  the  water-gate,  and  out  the  barrels  floated  on  the  stream,  bobbing  along, 
until they were carried by the current to a place far down the river where the bank 
jutted  out,  near  to  the  very  eastern  edge  of Mirkwood. There  they were  collected 
and  tied  together  and  floated  back  to  Lake-town,  which  stood  close  to  the  point 
where the Forest River flowed into the Long Lake. 
 
For  some  time Bilbo  sat and  thought about  this water-gate, and wondered if it 
could  be  used  for  the  escape  of  his  friends,  and  at  last  he  had  the  desperate 
beginnings of a plan. 
The  evening meal had been  taken  to  the prisoners. The guards were  tramping 
away  down  the  passages  taking  the  torch-light  with  them  and  leaving  everything 
in  darkness.  Then  Bilbo  heard  the  king's  butler  bidding  the  chief  of  the  guards 
good-night. 
"Now come with me," he said, "and taste the new wine that has just come in. I 
shall be hard at work tonight clearing the cellars of the empty wood, so let us have 
a drink first to help the labour." 
"Very good," laughed the chief of the guards. "I'll taste with you, and see if it is 
fit for the king's table. There is a feast tonight and it would not do to send up poor 
stuff!" 
 
When  he  heard  this  Bilbo  was  all  in  a  flutter,  for  he  saw  that  luck  was  with 
him  and  he  had  a  chance  at  once  to  try  his  desperate  plan.  He  followed  the  two 
elves, until  they entered a small cellar and sat down at a  table on which  two  large 
flagons were set. Soon they began to drink and laugh merrily. Luck of an unusual 
kind was with Bilbo  then.  It must be potent wine  to make a wood-elf drowsy; but 
this wine, it would seem, was the heady vintage of the great gardens of Dorwinion, 
not  meant  for  his  soldiers  or  his  servants,  but  for  the  king's  feasts  only,  and  for 
smaller bowls, not for the butler's great flagons. 
Very soon the chief guard nodded his head, then he laid it on the table and fell 
fast asleep. The butler went on talking and laughing to himself for a while without 
seeming to notice, but soon his head too nodded to the table, and he fell asleep and 
snored  beside  his  friend.  Then  in  crept  the  hobbit.  Very  soon  the chief guard had 

####-no  keys,  but Bilbo was  trotting  as  fast  as  he  could  along  the  passage  towards  the 
cells. The  great  bunch  seemed  very  heavy  to  his  arms,  and  his  heart was  often  in 
his  mouth,  in  spite  of  his  ring,  for  he  could  not  prevent  the  keys  from  making 
every now and then a loud clink and clank, which put him all in a tremble. 
First  he  unlocked  Balin's  door,  and  locked  it  again  carefully  as  soon  as  the 
dwarf was  outside. Balin was most  surprised,  as  you  can  imagine;  but  glad  as  he 
was  to  get  out  of  his  wearisome  little  stone  room,  he  wanted  to  stop  and  ask 
questions, and know what Bilbo was going to do, and all about it. 
"No  time  now!"  said  the  hobbit.  "You  must  follow  me!  We  must  all  keep 
together  and not  risk getting  separated. All of us must  escape or none,  and  this  is 
our  last  chance.  If  this  is  found out, goodness knows where  the king will put you 
next, with chains on your hands and feet  too, I expect. Don't argue,  there's a good 
fellow!" 
Then  off  he went  from  door  to  door,  until  his  following  had  grown  to  twelve-
none  of  them  any  too  nimble,  what  with  the  dark,  and  what  with  their  long 
imprisonment. Bilbo's heart thumped every time one of them bumped into another, 
or  grunted  or  whispered  in  the  dark.  "Drat  this  dwarvish  racket!"  he  said  to 
himself. But all went well, and they met no guards. As a matter of fact there was a 
great  autumn  feast  in  the woods  that night,  and  in  the halls  above. Nearly  all  the 
king's  folks  were  merrymaking.  At  last  after  much  blundering  they  came  to 
Thorin's  dungeon,  far  down  in  a  deep  place  and  fortunately  not  far  from  the 
cellars. 
"Upon my word!"  said Thorin, when Bilbo whispered to him to come out and 
join his  friends,  "Gandalf  spoke  true,  as usual. A pretty  fine burglar you make,  it 
seems,  when  the  time  comes.  I  am  sure  we  are  all  for  ever  at  your  service, 
whatever happens after this. But what comes next?" 
Bilbo saw that the time had come to explain his idea, as far as he could; but he 
did  not  feel  at  all  sure  bow  the  dwarves  would  take  it.  His  fears  were  quite 
justified, for they did not like it a bit, and started grumbling loudly in spite of their 
danger.  
"We  shall  be  bruised  and  battered  to  pieces,  and  drowned  too,  for  certain!" 
they muttered. "We thought you had got some sensible notion, when you managed 
to get hold of the keys. This is a mad idea!" 
"Very well!" said Bilbo very downcast, and also rather annoyed. "Come  along 
back  to  your  nice  cells,  and  I  will  lock  you  all  in  again,  and  you  can  sit  there 
comfortably  and  think  of  a  better  plan-but  I don't suppose  I shall ever get hold of 
the keys again, even if I feel inclined to try." 

####-"That  was  too  much  for  them,  and  they  calmed  down.  In  the  end,  of  course, 
they had to do just what Bilbo suggested, because it was obviously impossible for 
them  to  try  and  find  their  way  into  the  upper  halls,  or  to  fight  their  way  out  of 
gates  that  closed  by  magic;  and  it  was  no  good  grumbling  in  the  passages  until 
they were caught again. So following the hobbit, down into the lowest cellars they 
crept.  They  passed  a  door  through which  the  chief  guard  and  the  butler  could  be 
seen  still  happily  snoring  with  smiles  upon  their  faces.  The  wine  of Dorwinion 
brings  deep  and  pleasant  dreams.  There  would  be  a  different  expression  on  the 
face of  the  chief guard next day,  even  though Bilbo, before  they went on,  stole  in 
and kindheartedly put the keys back on his belt. 
"That  will  save  him  some  of  the  trouble  he  is  in  for,"  said  Mr.  Baggins  to 
himself.  "He wasn't  a  bad  fellow,  and  quite  decent  to  the  prisoners.  It will  puzzle 
them all too. They will think we had a very strong magic to pass through all those 
locked doors and disappear. Disappear! We have got to get busy very quick, if that 
is to happen!" 
 
Balin was  told  off  to watch  the  guard  and  the  butler  and  give warning  if  they 
stirred. The rest went  into  the adjoining cellar with  the  trapdoors. There was  little 
time  to  lose.  Before  long,  as  Bilbo  knew,  some  elves were  under  orders  to  come 
down and help  the butler get  the empty barrels  through  the doors  into  the  stream. 
These were in fact already standing in rows in the middle of the floor waiting to be 
pushed off. Some of them were wine-barrels, and these were not much use, as they 
could not easily be opened at the end without a deal of noise, nor could they easily 
be  secured  again.  But  among  them  were  several  others  which  had  been  used  for 
bringing other stuffs, butter, apples, and all sorts of things, to the king's palace. 
They  soon  found  thirteen with  room enough  for a dwarf  in each.  In  fact  some 
were  too  roomy,  and  as  they  climbed  in  the  dwarves  thought  anxiously  of  the 
shaking and  the bumping  they would get  inside,  though Bilbo did his best  to  find 
straw  and  other  stuff  to  pack  them  in  as  cosily  as  could  be  managed  in  a  short 
time. At  last  twelve  dwarves were  stowed. Thorin  had  given  a  lot  of  trouble,  and 
turned  and  twisted  in  his  tub  and  grumbled  like  a  large  dog  in  a  small  kennel; 
while Balin, who came last, made a great fuss about his air-holes and said he was 
stifling, even before his lid was on. Bilbo had done what he could to close holes in 
the  sides  of  the  barrels,  and  to  fix  on  all  the  lids  as  safely  as  could  be  managed, 
and  now  he  was  left  alone  again,  running  round  putting  the  finishing  touches-to 
the packing, and hoping against hope that his plan would come off. 

####-It  had  not  been  a-bit too soon. Only a minute or two after Balin's lid had been 
fitted  on  there  came  the  sound  of  voices  and  the  flicker  of  lights.  A  number  of 
elves  came  laughing  and  talking  into  the  cellars  and  singing  snatches  of  song. 
They had  left a merry feast  in one of  the halls and were bent on returning as soon 
as  they  could.  "Where's  old  Galion,  the  butler?"  said  one.  "I  haven't  seen  him  at 
the tables tonight. He ought to be here now to show us what is to be done." 
"I shall be angry  if  the old slowcoach  is  late," said another. "I have no wish  to 
waste time down here while the song is up!" 
"Ha, ha!" came a cry. "Here's  the old villain with his head on a jug! He's been 
having a little feast all to himself and his friend the captain." 
"Shake him! Wake him!" shouted the others impatiently. Gallon was not at all 
pleased at being shaken or wakened, and still  less at being  laughed at.  "You're all 
late," he grumbled. "Here am I waiting and waiting down here, while you fellows 
drink  and  make  merry  and  forget  your  tasks.  Small  wonder  if  I  fall  asleep  from 
weariness!" 
"Small  wonder,"  said  they,  "when  the  explanation  stands  close  at  hand  in  a 
jug! Come  give  us  a  taste  of  your  sleeping-draught before we  fall  to! No need  to 
wake the turnkey yonder. He has had his share by the looks of it." 
Then  they  drank  once  round  and  became  mighty  merry  all  of  a  sudden.  But 
they did not quite  lose  their wits. "Save us, Galion!" cried some, "you began your 
feasting  early  and  muddled  your  wits!  You  have  stacked  some  full  casks  here 
instead of the empty ones, if there is anything in weight." 
"Get on with the work!" growled the butler. "There is nothing in the feeling of 
weight  in  an  idle  toss-pot's  arms. These  are  the ones  to go  and no others. Do  as  I 
say!" 
"Very  well,  very  well,"  they  answered  rolling  the  barrels  to  the  opening.  "On 
your  head  be  it,  if  the  king's  full  buttertubs  and  his  best  wine  is  pushed  into  the 
river for the Lake-men to feast on for nothing!" 
 

Roll-roll-roll-roll, 
roll-roll-rolling down the hole I  
Heave ho! Splash plump ! 
Down they go, down they bump! 

 
So  they  sang as  first one barrel and  then another  rumbled  to  the dark opening 
and  was  pushed  over  into  the  cold  water  some  feet  below.  Some  were  barrels 
really empty, some were  tubs neatly packed with a dwarf each; but down  they all 
went,  one  after  another, with many  a  clash  and  a  bump,  thudding  on  top  of  ones 

####-below,  smacking  into  the water,  jostling against  the walls of  the  tunnel, knocking 
into one another, and bobbing away down the current. 
It was just at this moment that Bilbo suddenly discovered the weak point in his 
plan. Most  likely you  saw  it  some  time  ago  and have been  laughing  at him; but I 
don't suppose you would have done half as well yourselves in his place. Of course 
he was not  in a barrel himself, nor was  there anyone  to pack him  in, even  if  there 
had  been  a  chance!  It  looked  as  if  he  would  certainly  lose  his  friends  this  time 
(nearly  all  of  them  had  already  disappeared  through  the  dark  trap-door), and get 
utterly left behind and have to stay lurking as a permanent burglar in the elf-caves 
for ever. For even if he could have escaped through the upper gates at once, he had 
precious small chance of ever finding the dwarves again. He did not know the way 
by  land  to  the place where  the barrels were collected. He wondered what on earth 
would happen to them without him; for he had not had time to tell the dwarves all 
that  he  had  learned,  or what he had meant  to do, once  they were out of  the wood. 
While  all  these  thoughts  were  passing  through  his  mind,  the  elves  being  very 
merry  began  to  sing  a  song  round  the  river-door. Some had already gone  to haul 
on  the  ropes  which  pulled  up  the  portcullis  at  the  water-gate  so  as  to  let  out  the 
barrels as soon as they were all afloat below.  
 

Down the swift dark stream you go 
Back to lands you once did know! 
Leave the halls and caverns deep, 
Leave the northern mountains steep, 
Where the forest wide and dim 
Stoops in shadow grey and grim! 
Float beyond the world of trees 
Out into the whispering breeze, 
Past the rushes, past the reeds, 
Past the marsh's waving weeds, 
Through the mist that riseth white 
Up from mere and pool at night! 
Follow, follow stars that leap 
Up the heavens cold and steep; 
Turn when dawn comes over land, 
Over rapid, over sand, 
South away! and South away! 
Seek the sunlight and the day,  
Back to pasture, back to mead, 
Where the kine and oxen feed! 

####-Back to gardens on the hills 
Where the berry swells and fills 
Under sunlight, under day! 
South away! and South away! 
Down the swift dark stream you go 
Back to lands you once did know! 

 
Now  the  very  last  barrel  was  being  rolled  to  the  doors!  In  despair  and  not 
knowing what  else  to  do,  poor  little Bilbo  caught hold of  it  and was pushed over 
the edge with it. Down into the water he fell, splash! into the cold dark water with 
the  barrel  on  top  of  him. He  came  up  again  spluttering  and  clinging  to  the wood 
like a  rat, but  for all his efforts he could not scramble on top. Every time he tried, 
the  barrel  rolled  round  and  ducked  him  under  again.  It  was  really  empty,  and 
floated light as a cork. Though his ears were full of water, he could hear the elves 
still  singing  in  the  cellar  above.  Then  suddenly  the  trapdoors  fell  to with a boom 
and  their  voices  faded  away. He was  in  the  dark  tunnel,  floating  in  icy water,  all 
alone-for you cannot count friends that are all packed up in barrels. 
Very  soon a grey patch came up  in  the darkness ahead. He heard  the creak of 
the water-gate being hauled up, and he found that he was in the midst of a bobbing 
and  bumping mass  of  casks  and  tubs  all  pressing  together  to  pass  under  the  arch 
and  get  out  into  the  open  stream.  He  had  as  much  as  he  could  do  to  prevent 
himself  from  being  hustled  and  battered  to  bits;  but  at  last  the  jostling  crowd 
began to break up and swing off, one by one, under the stone arch and away. Then 
he saw  that  it would have been no good even  if he had managed  to get astride his 
barrel,  for  there was  no  room  to  spare, not  even  for  a hobbit, between  its  top  and 
the suddenly stooping roof where the gate was. 
 
Out  they  went  under  the  overhanging  branches  of  the  trees  on  either  bank. 
Bilbo  wondered  what  the  dwarves  were  feeling  and  whether  a  lot  of  water  was 
getting  into  their  tubs.  Some  of  those  that  bobbed  along  by  him  in  the  gloom 
seemed pretty low in the water, and he guessed that these had dwarves inside. 
"I do hope  I put  the  lids on  tight enough!" he  thought, but before  long he was 
worrying  too much  about  himself  to remember  the dwarves. He managed  to keep 
his head  above  the water, but he was  shivering with  the  cold,  and he wondered  if 
he would die of  it before  the  luck  turned, and how much  longer he would be able 
to hang on, and whether he should risk the chance of  letting go and trying to swim 
to the bank. 

####-The  luck  turned  all  right  before  long:  the  eddying  current  carried  several 
barrels  close  ashore  at  one  point  and  there  for  a  while  they  stuck  against  some 
hidden  root.  Then  Bilbo  took  the  opportunity  of  scrambling  up  the  side  of  his 
barrel while it was held steady against another. Up he crawled like a drowned rat, 
and lay on the top spread out to keep the balance as best he could. The breeze was 
cold  but  better  than  the water,  and  he  hoped  he would  not  suddenly  roll off again 
when  they  started  off  once  more.  Before  long  the  barrels  broke  free  again  and 
turned  and  twisted  off  down  the  stream,  and  out  into  the  main  current  Then  he 
found it quite as difficult to stick on as he had feared; but he managed it somehow, 
though  it was miserably uncomfortable. Luckily he was very  light, and  the barrel 
was  a  good  big  one  and  being  rather  leaky  had  now  shipped  a  small  amount  of 
water. All  the  same  it was  like  trying  to  ride, without  bridle  or  stirrups,  a  round-
bellied  pony  that  was  always  thinking  of  rolling  on  the  grass.  In  this  way  at  last 
Mr. Baggins came to a place where the trees on either hand grew thinner. He could 
see the paler sky between them. The dark river opened suddenly wide, and there it 
was  joined  to  the  main  water of  the Forest River  flowing down  in haste  from  the 
king's  great  doors.  There was  a  dim  sheet  of water  no  longer  overshadowed,  and 
on  its  sliding  surface  there were  dancing  and  broken  reflections  of  clouds  and  of 
stars. Then  the hurrying water of  the Forest River swept all the company of casks 
and tubs away to the north bank, in which it had eaten out a wide bay. This had a 
shingly  shore  under  hanging  banks  and  was  walled  at  the  eastern  end  by  a  little 
jutting  cape  of  hard  rock.  On  the  shallow  shore  most  of  the barrels  ran  aground, 
though a few went on to bump against the stony pier.  
There  were  people  on  the  look-out  on  the  banks.  They  quickly  poled  and 
pushed all the barrels together into the shallows, and when they had counted them 
they  roped  them  together and left them till the morning. Poor dwarves! Bilbo was 
not  so  badly  off  now.  He  slipped  from  his  barrel  and  waded  ashore,  and  then 
sneaked  along  to  some huts  that he  could  see near  the water's  edge. He no  longer 
thought  twice  about  picking  up  a  supper  uninvited  if  he  got  the  chance,  he  had 
been  obliged  to  do  it  for  so  long,  and  he  knew  only  too  well  what  it  was  to  be 
really  hungry,  not merely  politely  interested  in  the  dainties  of  a well-filled larder. 
Also he had caught a glimpse of a fire  through  the  trees, and that appealed to him 
with his dripping and ragged clothes clinging to him cold and clammy.  
 
There is no need to tell you much of his adventures that night, for now we are 
drawing  near  the  end  of  the  eastward  journey  and  coming  to  the  last  and  greatest 
adventure,  so  we  must  hurry  on.  Of  course  helped  by  his  magic  ring  he  got  on 

####-very well  at  first,  but  he was  given  away  in  the  end  by  his wet  footsteps  and  the 
trail of drippings that he left wherever he went or sat; and also he began to snivel, 
and  wherever  he  tried  to  hide  he  was  found  out  by  the  terrific  explosions  of  his 
suppressed  sneezes.  Very  soon  there  was  a  fine  commotion  in  the  village  by  the 
riverside; but Bilbo escaped  into  the woods carrying a  loaf and a  leather bottle of 
wine and a pie that did not belong to him. The rest of the night he had to pass wet 
as he was and far from a fire, but the bottle helped him to do that, and he actually 
dozed a little on some dry leaves, even though the year was getting late and the air 
was chilly.  
He woke again with a specially loud sneeze. It was already grey morning, and 
there was a merry racket down by the river. They were making up a raft of barrels, 
and  the  raft-elves  would  soon  be  steering  it  off  down  the  stream  to  Lake-town. 
Bilbo  sneezed  again.  He  was  no  longer  dripping  but  he  felt  cold  all  over.  He 
scrambled down as  fast as his  stiff  legs would  take him and managed  just  in  time 
to get on to the mass of casks without being noticed in the general bustle. Luckily 
there was  no  sun  at  the  time  to  cast  an  awkward  shadow,  and  for  a mercy he did 
not sneeze again for a good while. 
There  was  a  mighty  pushing  of  poles.  The  elves  that  were  standing  in  the 
shallow  .water  heaved  and  shoved.  The  barrels  now  all  lashed  together  creaked 
and fretted.  . 
"This is a heavy load!" some grumbled. "They float too deep-some of these are 
never  empty.  If  they  had  come  ashore  in  the  daylight, we might  have  had  a  look 
inside," they said. 
"No time now!" cried the raftman. "Shove off!" 
And off they went at last, slowly at first, until they had passed the point of rock 
where other elves stood  to fend  them off with poles, and  then quicker and quicker 
as  they  caught  the  main  stream  and  went  sailing  away  down,  down  towards  the 
Lake. 
They  had  escaped  the  dungeons  of  the  king  and  were  through  the wood,  but 
whether alive or dead still remains to be seen. 
 

####-<h4>Chapter 10</h4> <br> 

A Warm Welcome 

 
The day grew lighter and warmer as they floated along. After a while the river 
rounded  a  steep  shoulder  of  land  that  came  down  upon  their  left. Under  its  rocky 
feet  like  an  inland  cliff  the  deepest  stream  had  flowed  lapping  and  bubbling. 
Suddenly  the  cliff  fell  away. The  shores  sank. The  trees  ended. Then Bilbo  saw  a 
sight: The  lands opened wide  about him,  filled with  the waters of  the  river which 
broke  up  and  wandered  in  a  hundred  winding  courses,  or  halted  in  marshes  and 
pools  dotted  with  isles  on  every  side:  but  still  a  strong  water  flowed  on  steadily 
through  the midst. And  far  away,  its  dark  head  in  a  torn  cloud,  there  loomed  the 
Mountain!  Its  nearest  neighbours  to  the  North-East  and  the  tumbled  land  that 
joined it to them could not be seen. All alone it rose and looked across the marshes 
to  the  forest.  The  Lonely  Mountain!  Bilbo  had  come  far  and  through  many 
adventures to see it, and now he did not like the look of it in the least. 
As  he  listened  to  the  talk  of  the  raftmen  and  pieced  together  the  scraps  of 
information  they  let  fall, he  soon  realized  that he was very  fortunate  ever  to have 
seen  it  at  all,  even  from  this  distance.  Dreary  as  had  been  his  imprisonment and 
unpleasant  as  was  his  position  (to  say  nothing  of  the  poor  dwarves  underneath 
him)  still,  he  had  been  more  lucky  than  he  had  guessed.  The  talk  was  all  of  the 
trade  that  came  and  went  on  the  waterways  and  the  growth  of  the  traffic  on  the 
river, as  the  roads out of  the East  towards Mirkwood vanished or  fell  into disuse; 
and of the bickerings of the Lake-men and the Wood-elves about the upkeep of the 
Forest River and the care of the banks. 
Those  lands  had  changed  much  since  the  days  when  dwarves  dwelt  in  the 
Mountain,  days  which  most  people  now  remembered  only  as  a  very  shadowy 
tradition.  They  had  changed  even  in  recent  years,  and  since  the  last  news  that 
Gandalf  had  had  of  them.  Great  floods  and  rains  had  swollen  the  waters  that 
flowed  east;  and  there had been  an  earthquake or  two  (which  some were  inclined 
to attribute to the dragon-alluding to him chiefly with a curse and an ominous nod 
in  the  direction  of  the  Mountain).  The  marshes  and  bogs  had  spread  wider  and 
wider  on  either  side.  Paths  had  vanished,  and many  a  rider  and wanderer  too,  if 
they  had  tried  to  find  the  lost  ways  across.  The  elf-road  through  the wood which 
the dwarves had followed on the advice of Beorn now came to a doubtful and little 
used  end  at  the  eastern  edge  of  the  forest;  only  the  river offered any  longer a safe 

####-way  from  the  skirts  of  Mirkwood  in  the  North  to  the  mountain-shadowed plains 
beyond, and the river was guarded by the Wood-elves' king. 
So  you  see Bilbo  had  come  in  the  end  by  the  only  road  that was  any  good.  It 
might have  been  some  comfort  to Mr. Baggins  shivering on  the barrels,  if he had 
known  that  news  of  this  had  reached  Gandalf  far  away  and  given  him  great 
anxiety, and  that he was  in  fact  finishing his other business  (which does not come 
into this tale) and getting ready to come in search of Thorin's company. But Bilbo 
did not know it. 
All he knew was that the river seemed to go on and on and on for ever, and he 
was  hungry,  and  had  a  nasty  cold  in  the  nose,  and  did  not  like  the  way  the 
Mountain seemed to frown at him and threaten him as it drew ever nearer. After a 
while, however,  the  river  took a more southerly course and  the Mountain  receded 
again,  and  at  last,  late  in  the  day  the  shores  grew  rocky,  the  river  gathered  all  its 
wandering  waters  together  into  a  deep  and  rapid  flood,  and  they  swept  along  at 
great speed. 
The  sun had  set when  turning with another  sweep  towards  the East  the  forest-
river  rushed  into  the  Long  Lake.  There  it  had  a  wide  mouth  with  stony  clifflike 
gates at either side whose feet were piled with shingles. The Long Lake! Bilbo had 
never  imagined  that  any  water  that  was  not  the  sea  could  look  so  big.  It  was  so 
wide  that  the  opposite  shores  looked  small  and  far,  but  it  was  so  long  that  its 
northerly end, which pointed towards the Mountain, could not be  seen at all. Only 
from the map did Bilbo know that away up there, where the stars of the Wain were 
already  twinkling,  the  Running  River  came  down  into  the  lake  from  Dale  and 
with  the  Forest  River  filled  with  deep  waters  what  must  once  have  been  a  great 
deep  rocky  valley. At  the  southern  end  the  doubled waters  poured  out  again  over 
high waterfalls  and  ran  away  hurriedly  to  unknown  lands.  In  the  still  evening  air 
the noise of the falls could be heard like a distant roar.  
Not  far  from  the mouth  of  the Forest River was the strange town he heard the 
elves speak of in the king's cellars. It was not built on the shore, though there were 
a  few  huts  and  buildings  there,  but  right  out  on  the  surface  of  the  lake,  protected 
from  the swirl of  the entering river by a promontory of rock which formed a calm 
bay. A great  . bridge made of wood ran out to where on huge piles made of forest 
trees  was  built  a  busy  wooden  town,  not  a  town  of  elves  but  of  Men,  who  still 
dared  to  dwell  here  under  the  shadow  of  the  distant  dragon-mountain. They  still 
throve  on  the  trade  that  came  up  the  great  river  from  the  South  and  was  carted 
past  the  falls  to  their  town;  but  in  the  great  days  of  old,  when  Dale  in  the  North 
was rich and prosperous, they had been wealthy and powerful, and there had been 

####-fleets  of  boats  on  the  waters,  and  some  were  filled  with  gold  and  some  with 
warriors  in  armour,  and  there  had  been  wars  and  deeds  which  were  now  only  a 
legend.  The  rotting  piles  of  a  greater  town  could  still  be  seen  along  the  shores 
when the waters sank in a drought. 
But men  remembered  little of  all  that,  though  some  still  sang old  songs of  the 
dwarf-kings  of  the Mountain,  Thror  and  Thrain  of  the  race  of  Durin,  and  of  the 
coming of the Dragon, and the fall of the lords of Dale. Some sang too that Thror 
and Thrain would  come  back  one  day  and  gold would  flow  in  rivers  through  the 
mountain-gates, and all that land would be filled with new song and new laughter. 
But this pleasant legend did not much affect their daily business. 
 
As  soon  as  the  raft  of  barrels  came  in  sight boats  rowed out  from  the piles of 
the  town,  and  voices  hailed  the  raft-steerers. Then  ropes were  cast  and oars were 
pulled,  and  soon  the  raft  was  drawn  out  of  the  current  of  the  Forest  River  and 
towed  away  round  the  high  shoulder  of  rock  into  the  little  bay  of  Lake-town. 
There  it  was  moored  not  far  from  the  shoreward  head  of  the  great  bridge.  Soon 
men would come up  from  the South and  take  some of  the casks away, and others 
they would fill with goods they had brought to be taken back up the stream to the 
Wood-elves' home. In the meanwhile the barrels were left afloat while the elves of 
the raft and the boatmen went to feast in Lake-town. 
They would have been surprised, if they could have seen what happened down 
by  the  shore,  after  they  had  gone  and  the  shades  of  night  had  fallen. First  of  all  a 
barrel was  cut  loose  by Bilbo  and  pushed  to  the  shore  and  opened. Groans  came 
from  inside,  and  out  crept  a most  unhappy  dwarf. Wet  straw was  in  his  draggled 
beard;  he  was  so  sore  and  stiff,  so  bruised  and  buffeted  he  could  hardly  stand  or 
stumble through the shallow water to lie groaning on the shore. He had a famished 
and a savage look like a dog that has been chained and forgotten in a kennel for a 
week.  It was Thorin,  but  you  could  only  have  told  it  by his golden chain, and by 
the  colour  of  his  now  dirty  and  tattered  sky-blue  hood  with  its  tarnished  silver 
tassel. It was some time before he would be even polite to the hobbit. 
"Well,  are  you  alive  or  are  you  dead?"  asked  Bilbo  quite  crossly.  Perhaps  he 
had  forgotten  that he had had  at  least one good meal more  than  the dwarves,  and 
also  the use of his  arms  and  legs, not  to  speak of  a greater  allowance of  air.  "Are 
you still in prison, or are you free? If you want food, and if you want to go on with 
this silly adventure- it's yours after all and not mine-you had better slap your arms 
and rub your legs and try and help me get the others out while there is a chance!" 

####-Thorin  of  course  saw  the  sense  of  this,  so  after  a  few  more  groans  he  got  up 
and  helped  the  hobbit as well as he could.  In  the darkness  floundering  in  the cold 
water  they had a difficult and very nasty  job  finding which were  the  right barrels. 
Knocking  outside  and  calling  only  discovered  about  six  dwarves  that  could 
answer.  They  were  unpacked  and  helped  ashore where  they  sat  or  lay muttering 
and  moaning;  they  were  so  soaked  and  bruised  and  cramped  that  they  could 
hardly yet realize their release or be properly thankful for it. 
Dwalin  and  Balin  were  two  of  the most  unhappy,  and  it  was  no  good  asking 
them  to  help.  Bifur  and  Bofur  were  less  knocked  about  and  drier,  but  they  lay 
down  and  would  do  nothing.  Fili  and  Kili,  however,  who  were  young  (for 
dwarves) and had also been packed more neatly with plenty of  straw  into  smaller 
casks, came out more or less smiling, with only a bruise or two and a stiffness that 
soon wore off. 
"I hope I never smell the smell of apples again!" said Fili. "My tub was full of 
it.  To  smell  apples  everlastingly  when  you  can  scarcely  move  and  are  cold  and 
sick  with  hunger  is  maddening.  I  could  eat  anything  in  the  wide  world  now,  for 
hours on end-but not an apple!" 
With  the willing help of Fili  and Kili, Thorin  and Bilbo  at  last discovered  the 
remainder  of  the  company  and  got  them  out.  Poor  fat  Bombur  was  asleep  or 
senseless; Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin and Gloin were waterlogged and seemed only half 
alive; they all had to be carried one by one and laid helpless on the shore. 
"Well! Here we are!" said Thorin. "And I suppose we ought to thank our stars 
and Mr. Baggins. I am sure he has a right to expect it, though I wish he could have 
arranged  a  more  comfortable  journey.  Still-all  very  much  at  your  service  once 
more, Mr. Baggins. No doubt we shall feel properly grateful, when we are fed and 
recovered. In the meanwhile what next?" 
"I suggest Lake-town," said Bilbo, "What else is there?" Nothing else could, of 
course, be suggested; so leaving the others Thorin and Fili and Kili and the hobbit 
went  along  the  shore  to  the  great  bridge. There were  guards  at  the  head  of  it,  but 
they were  not  keeping very careful watch,  for  it was  so  long  since  there had been 
any  real  need. Except  for  occasional  squabbles  about  river-tolls they were friends 
with the Wood-elves. Other folk were far away; and some of the younger people in 
the town openly doubted the existence of any dragon in the mountain, and laughed 
at  the greybeards and gammers who  said  that  they had  seen him  flying  in  the  sky 
in  their  young  days.  That  being  so  it  is  not  surprising  that  the  guards  were 
drinking  and  laughing  by  a  fire  in  their  hut,  and  did  not  hear  the  noise  of  the 

####-unpacking  of  the  dwarves  or  the  footsteps  of  the  four  scouts.  Their  astonishment 
was enormous when Thorin Oakenshield stepped in through the door.  
"Who  are  you  and what  do  you want?"  they  shouted  leaping  to  their  feet  and 
gipping for weapons. 
"Thorin son of Thrain son of Thror King under the Mountain!" said the dwarf 
in  a  loud  voice,  and  he  looked  it,  in  spite  of  his  torn  clothes  and  draggled  hood. 
The  gold  gleamed  on  his  neck  and  waist:  his  eyes  were  dark  and  deep.  "I  have 
come back. I wish to see the Master of your town!" 
Then  there  was  tremendous  excitement.  Some  of  the  more  foolish  ran  out  of 
the  hut  as  if  they  expected  the  Mountain  to  go  golden  in  the  night  and  all  the 
waters  of  the  lake  to  turn  yellow  right  away.  The  captain  of  the  guard  came 
forward. 
"And who are these?" he asked, pointing to Fili and: Kili and Bilbo. 
"The sons of my father's daughter," answered Thorin, "Fili and Kili of the race 
of Durin, and Mr. Baggins who has travelled with us out of the West." 
"If you come in peace lay down your arms!" said the captain. 
"We  have  none,"  said  Thorin,  and  it  was  true  enough:  their  knives  had  been 
taken from them by the wood-elves, and the great sword Orcrist too. Bilbo had his 
short sword, hidden as usual, but he said nothing about that. "We have no need of 
weapons,  who  return  at  last  to  our  own  as  spoken  of  old.  Nor  could  we  fight 
against so many. Take us to your master!" 
"He is at feast," said the captain. 
"Then all the more reason for taking us to him," burst in Fili, who was getting 
impatient at these solemnities. "We are worn and famished after our long road and 
we have sick comrades. Now make haste and  let us have no more words, or your 
master may have something to say to you." 
"Follow me  then,"  said  the  captain,  and with  six men  about  them he  led  them 
over  the bridge  through  the gates and  into  the market-place of the town. This was 
a  wide  circle  of  quiet  water  surrounded  by  the  tall  piles  on  which  were  built  the 
greater  houses,  and  by  long  wooden  quays  with  many  steps  and  ladders  going 
down  to  the  surface  of  the  lake. From  one  great  hall  shone many  lights  and  there 
came  the  sound  of many  voices.  They  passed  its  doors  and  stood  blinking  in  the 
light looking at long tables filled with folk. 
"I  am Thorin  son  of Thrain  son of Thror King under the Mountain! I return!" 
cried Thorin in a loud voice from the door, before the captain could say anything. 
All  leaped  to  their  feet.  The Master  of  the  town  sprang  from  his  great  chair.  But 

####-none  rose  in greater surprise  than  the  raft-men of the elves who were sitting at the 
lower end of the hall. Pressing forward before the Master's table they cried: 
"These  are  prisoners  of  our  king  that  have  escaped,  wandering  vagabond 
dwarves that could not give any good account of themselves, sneaking through the 
woods and molesting our people!" 
"Is  this  true?"  asked  the  Master.  As  a  matter  of  fact  he  thought  it  far  more 
likely than the return of the King under the Mountain, if any such person had ever 
existed. 
"It  is  true  that we were wrongfully waylaid by the Elven-king and imprisoned 
without  cause  as  we  journeyed  back  to  our  own  land,"  answered  Thorin.  "But 
lock  nor  bar  may  hinder  the  homecoming  spoken  of  old.  Nor  is  this  town  in  the 
Wood-elves' realm. I speak to the Master of the town of the Men of the lake, not to 
the raft-men of the king." 
Then  the  Master  hesitated  and  looked  from  one  to  the  other.  The  Elvenking 
was  very  powerful  in  those  parts  and  the Master wished  for  no  enmity with  him, 
nor did he  think much of old songs, giving his mind  to  .trade and tolls, to cargoes 
and  gold,  to  which  habit  he  owed  his  position.  Others  were  of  different  mind, 
however,  and  quickly  the  matter  was  settled  without  him.  The  news  had  spread 
from  the  doors  of  the  hall  like  fire  through  all  the  town.  People  were  shouting 
inside  the  hall  and  outside  it. The  quays were  thronged with  hurrying  feet.  Some 
began  to  sing  snatches  of  old  songs  concerning  the  return  of  the  King  under  the 
Mountain;  that  it was Thror's grandson not Thror himself  that had come back did 
not bother them at all. Others took up the song and it rolled loud and high over the 
lake. 
 

The King beneath the mountains, 
The King of carven stone, 
The lord of silver fountains 
Shall come into his own! 
 
His crown shall be upholden, 
His harp shall be restrung, 
His halls shall echo golden 
To songs of yore re-sung. 
 
The woods shall wave on mountains 
And grass beneath the sun; 
His wealth shall flow in fountains 
And the rivers golden run. 

####- 
The streams shall run in gladness, 
The lakes shall shine and burn, 
And sorrow fail and sadness 
At the Mountain -king's return! 
 
So they sang, or very like that, only there was a great deal more of it, and there 
was much  shouting as well as  the music of harps and of  fiddles mixed up with  it. 
Indeed  such  excitement  had  not  been  known  in  the  town  in  the  memory  of  the 
oldest  grandfather. The Wood-elves  themselves began  to wonder greatly and even 
to  be  afraid.  They  did  not  know  of  course  how  Thorin  had  escaped,  and  they 
began to think their king might have made a serious mistake. As for the Master he 
saw  there was nothing else for  it but  to obey  the general clamour, for  the moment 
at any rate, and to pretend to believe that Thorin was what he said. So he gave up 
to  him  his  own  great  chair  and  set  Fili  and  Kili  beside  him  in  places  of  honour.  
Even  Bilbo  was  given  a  seat  at  the  high  table,  and  no  explanation  of  where  he 
came  in-no  songs  had  alluded  to  him  even  in  the  obscurest way-was asked  for  in 
the general bustle. 
Soon afterwards  the other dwarves were brought  into  the  town amid scenes of 
astonishing enthusiasm. They were all doctored and fed and housed and pampered 
in  the  most  delightful  and  satisfactory  fashion.  A  large  house  was  given  up  to 
Thorin  and  his  company;  boats  and  rowers were  put  at  their  service;  and  crowds 
sat outside and sang  songs all day, or cheered if any dwarf showed so much as his 
nose. 
Some of the songs were old ones; but some of them were quite new and spoke 
confidently  of  the  sudden  death  of  the  dragon  and  of  cargoes  of  rich  presents 
coming  down  the  river  to  Lake-town.  These were  inspired  largely  by  the Master 
and  they  did  not  particularly  please  the  dwarves,  but  in  the  meantime  they  were 
well  contented  and  they  quickly  grew  fat  and  strong  again.  Indeed within  a week 
they  were  quite  recovered,  fitted  out  in  fine  cloth  of  their  proper  colours,  with 
beards combed and trimmed, and proud steps. Thorin looked and walked as if his 
kingdom was already regained and Smaug chopped up into little pieces. 
Then,  as he had  said,  the dwarves' good  feeling  towards  the  little hobbit grew 
stronger  every  day.  There  were  no  more  groans  or  grumbles.  They  drank  his 
health, and they patted him on the back, and they made a great fuss of him; which 
was just as well, for he was not feeling particularly cheerful. He had not forgotten 
the  look  of  the  Mountain,  nor  the  thought  of  the  dragon,  and  he  had  besides  a 

####-shocking  cold.  For  three  days  he  sneezed  and  coughed,  and  he  could  not  go  out, 
and even after that his speeches at banquets were limited to "Thag you very buch." 
 
In the meanwhile the Wood-elves had gone back up the Forest River with their 
cargoes,  and  there  was  great  excitement  in  the  king's  palace.  I  have  never  heard 
what  happened  to  the  chief  of  the  guards  and  the  butler.  Nothing  of  course  was 
ever said about keys or barrels while  the dwarves stayed in Lake-town, and Bilbo 
was careful never to become invisible. Still, I daresay, more was guessed than was 
known, though doubtless Mr. Baggins remained a bit of a mystery. In any case the 
king knew now the dwarves' errand, or thought he did, and he said to himself: 
"Very well! We'll see! No treasure will come back through Mirkwood without 
my having something to say in the matter. But I expect they will all come to a bad 
end, and serve them right!" He at any rate did not believe in dwarves fighting and 
killing  dragons  like  Smaug,  and  he  strongly  suspected  attempted  burglary  or 
something  like  it  which  shows  he  was  a  wise  elf  and  wiser  than  the  men  of  the 
town, though not quite right, as we shall see in the end. He sent out his spies about 
the  shores  of  the  lake  and  as  far northward  towards  the Mountains  as  they would 
go, and waited. 
At  the  end  of  a  fortnight  Thorin  began  to  think  of  departure.  While  the 
enthusiasm  still  lasted  in  the  town was  the  time  to get help.  It would not do  to  let 
everything  cool  down  with  delay.  So  he  spoke  to  the  Master  and  his  councillors 
and said that soon he and his company must go on towards the Mountain. 
Then for  the first  time  the Master was surprised and a  little frightened; and he 
wondered  if  Thorin  was  after  all  really  a  descendant  of  the  old  kings.  He  had 
never  thought  that  the  dwarves  would  actually  dare  to  approach  Smaug,  but 
believed  they were  frauds who would sooner or  later be discovered and be  turned 
out. He was wrong. Thorin, of  course, was  really  the grandson of  the King under 
the  Mountain,  and  there  is  no  knowing  what  a  dwarf  will  not  dare  and  do  for 
revenge or the recovery of his own. But the Master was not sorry at all to let them 
go.  They  were  expensive  to  keep,  and  their  arrival  had  turned  things  into  a  long 
holiday in which business was at a standstill. 
"Let them go and bother Smaug, and see how he welcomes them!" he thought. 
"Certainly,  O  Thorin  Thrain's  son  Thror's  son!"  was  what  he  said.  "You  must 
claim your own. The hour  is at hand, spoken of old. What help we can offer shall 
be yours, and we trust to your gratitude when your kingdom is regained." 
So  one  day,  although  autumn  was  now  getting  far  on,  and  winds  were  cold, 
and  leaves  were  falling  fast,  three  large  boats  left  Lake-town,  laden with  rowers, 

####-dwarves,  Mr.  Baggins,  and  many  provisions.  Horses  and  ponies  had  been  sent 
round  by  circuitous  paths  to  meet  them  at  their  appointed  landing-place.  The 
Master  and  his  councillors  bade  them  farewell  from  the  great  steps  of  the  town-
hall  that  went  down  to  the  lake.  People  sang  on  the  quays  and  out  of  windows. 
The  white  oars  dipped  and  splashed,  and  off  they  went  north  up  the  lake  on  the 
last stage of their long journey. The only person thoroughly unhappy was Bilbo.

On the Doorstep 

 
In  two  days  going  they  rowed  right up  the Long Lake and passed out  into  the 
River  Running,  and  now  they  could  all  see  the  Lonely  Mountain  towering  grim 
and  tall  before  them.  The  stream was  strong  and  their  going  slow. At  the;  end  of 
the third day, some miles up the river, they drew in to the left or western bank and 
disembarked.  Here  they  were  joined  by  the  horses  with  other  provisions  and 
necessaries and the ponies for their own use that had been sent to meet them. They 
packed what  they  could  on  the  ponies  and  the  rest was made  into  a  store under  a 
tent,  but  none  of  the men  of  the  town would  stay with  them  even  for  the  night  so 
near the shadow of the Mountain. 
"Not  at  any  rate  until  the  songs  have  come  true!"  said  they.  It  was  easier  to 
believe in the Dragon and less easy to believe in Thorin in these wild parts. Indeed 
their stores had no need of any guard, for all  the  land was desolate and empty. So 
their escort  left  them, making off  swiftly down  the  river and  the  shoreward paths, 
although the night was already drawing on. 
They spent a cold and  lonely night and  their spirits  fell. The next day  they set 
out  again. Balin  and Bilbo  rode  behind,  each  leading  another  pony  heavily  laden 
beside  him;  the  others  were  some  way  ahead  picking  out  a  slow  road,  for  there 
were no paths. They made north-west, slanting away from the River Running, and 
drawing ever nearer and nearer to a great spur of the Mountain that was flung out 
southwards towards them. 
It was a weary journey, and a quiet and stealthy one. There was no laughter or 
song or sound of harps, and the pride and hopes which had stirred in their hearts at 
the  singing  of  old  songs  by  the  lake  died  away  to  a  plodding  gloom.  They  knew 
that they were drawing near to the end of their journey, and that it might be a very 
horrible end. The land about them grew bleak and barren, though once, as Thorin 
told  them,  it had been green and fair. There was  little grass, and before  long  there 
was neither bush nor tree, and only broken and blackened stumps to speak of ones 
long  vanished.  They  were  come  to  the  Desolation  of  the  Dragon,  and  they  were 
come at the waning of the year.  
 
They  reached  the  skirts  of  the  Mountain  all  the  same  without  meeting  any 
danger or any sign of the Dragon other than the wilderness he had made about his 
lair.  The Mountain  lay  dark  and  silent  before  them  and  ever  higher  above  them. 

####-They made  their  first  camp  on  the western  side  of  the  great  southern  spur, which 
ended  in  a  height  called Ravenhill. On  this  there  had  been  an  old watch-post; but 
they dared not climb it yet, it was too exposed. 
Before  setting  out  to  search  the western  spurs  of  the Mountain  for  the  hidden 
door, on which all their hopes rested, Thorin sent out a scouting expedition to spy 
out  the  land  to  the  South  where  the  Front  Gate  stood.  For  this  purpose  he  chose 
Balin  and Fili  and Kili,  and with  them went Bilbo. They marched under  the grey 
and silent cliffs to the feet of Ravenhill. There the river, after winding a wide loop 
over the valley of Dale, turned from the Mountain on its road to the Lake, flowing 
swift and noisily. Its bank was bare and rocky, tall and steep above the stream; and 
gazing  out  from  it  over  the  narrow  water,  foaming  and  splashing  among  many 
boulders,  they  could  see  in  the wide valley  shadowed by  the Mountain's  arms  the 
grey ruins of ancient houses, towers, and walls. 
"There  lies  all  that  is  left  of  Dale,"  said  Balin.  "The  mountain's  sides  were 
green with woods  and  all  the  sheltered  valley  rich  and  pleasant  in  the  days when 
the  bells  rang  in  that  town." He  looked  both  sad  and  grim  as  he  said  this: he had 
been one of Thorin's companions on the day the Dragon came. 
They did not dare to follow the river much further to. wards the Gate; but they 
went on beyond the end of the southern spur, until lying hidden behind a rock they 
could  look  out  and  see  the  dark  cavernous  opening  in  a  great  cliff-wall between 
the  arms  of  the Mountain. Out  of  it  the waters  of  the Running River  sprang;  and 
out  of  it  too  there  came  a  steam  and  a  dark  smoke. Nothing moved  in  the waste, 
save  the  vapour  and  the  water,  and  every  now  and  again  a  black  and  ominous 
crow. The only sound was  the sound of  the stony water, and every now and again 
the harsh croak of a bird. Balin shuddered. 
"Let us return!" he said. "We can do no good here!– And I don't like these dark 
birds, they look like spies of evil." 
"The dragon is still alive and in the halls under the Mountain then-or I imagine 
so from the smoke," said the hobbit. 
"That  does  not  prove  it,"  said Balin,  "though  I  don't  doubt  you  are  right. But 
he might be gone  away  some  time, or  he might be lying out on the mountain-side 
keeping watch, and still I expect smokes and steams would come out of the gates: 
all the halls within must be filled with his foul reek." 
 
With  such  gloomy  thoughts,  followed  ever  by  croaking  crows  above  them, 
they made  their weary way  back  to  the  camp. Only  in  June  they  had  been  guests 
in  the fair house of Elrond, and  though autumn was now crawling  towards winter 

####-that  pleasant  time  now  seemed  years  ago.  They were  alone  in  the  perilous waste 
without  hope  of  further  help. They were  at  the  end  of  their  journey,  but  as  far  as 
ever, it seemed, from the end of their quest. None of them had much spirit left. 
Now  strange  to  say  Mr.  Baggins  had  more  than  the  others.  He  would  often 
borrow Thorin's map  and  gaze  at  it,  pondering over  the  runes and  the message of 
the  moon-letters  Elrond  had  read.  It  was  he  that  made  the  dwarves  begin  the 
dangerous  search  on  the  western  slopes  for  the  secret  door.  They  moved  their 
camp  then  to  a  long  valley,  narrower  than  the  great  dale  in  the  South where  the 
Gates  of  the  river  stood,  and  walled  with  lower  spurs  of  the  Mountain.  Two  of 
these  here  thrust  forward west  from  the main mass  in  long  steep-sided ridges  that 
fell ever downwards towards the plain. On this western side there were fewer signs 
of  the  dragon's  marauding  feet,  and  there  was  some  grass  for  their  ponies.  From 
this western  camp,  shadowed  all day by  cliff  and wall until  the  sun began  to  sink 
towards  the  forest,  day  by  day  they  toiled  in  parties  searching  for  paths  up  the 
mountain-side. If the map was true, somewhere high above the cliff at the valley's 
head must stand the secret door. Day by day they came back to their camp without 
success. 
But at  last unexpectedly  they  found what  they were seeking. Fili and Kili and 
the  hobbit went  back one day down  the valley and scrambled among  the  tumbled 
rocks  at  its  southern  corner.  About  midday,  creeping  behind  a  great  stone  that 
stood  alone  like  a  pillar,  Bilbo  came  on  what  looked  like  rough  steps  going 
upwards.  Following  these  excitedly  he  and  the dwarves  found  traces of  a narrow 
track,  often  lost,  often  rediscovered,  that  wandered  on  to  the  top  of  the  southern 
ridge and brought them at last to a still narrower ledge, which turned north across 
the  face of  the Mountain. Looking down  they  saw  that they were at the top of the 
cliff  at  the  valley's  head  and  were  gazing  down  on  to  their  own  camp  below. 
Silently, clinging to the rocky wall on their right, they went in single file along the 
ledge,  till  the  wall  opened  and  they  turned  into  a  little  steep-walled  bay,  grassy-
floored,  still  and quiet.  Its  entrance which  they had  found  could not be  seen  from 
below because of  the overhang of  the  cliff, nor  from  further off because  it was  so 
small that it looked like a dark crack and no more. It was not a cave and was open 
to  the  sky  above;  but  at  its  inner  end  a  flat  wall  rose  up  that  in  the  lower  I  part, 
close  to  the  ground,  was  as  smooth  and  upright  as  mason's  work,  but  without  a 
joint or crevice to be seen. 
"No sign was  there of post or  lintel or  threshold, nor any sign of bar or bolt or 
key-hole; yet they did not doubt that they had found the door at last. 

####-They  beat  on  it,  they  thrust  and  pushed  at  it,  they  implored  it  to  move,  they 
spoke  fragments of broken  spells of opening, and nothing  stirred. At  last  tired out 
they.  rested  on  the  grass  at  its  feet,  and  then  at  evening  began,  their  long  climb 
down. 
 
There was excitement  in  the camp  that night.  In  the morning  they prepared  to 
move  once  more.  Only  Bofur  and  Bombur  were  left  behind  to  guard  the  ponies 
and  such  stores  as  they  had  brought  with  them  from  the  river.  The  others  went 
down  the  valley  and  up  the  newly  found  path,  and  so  to  the  narrow  ledge. Along 
this  they could carry no bundles or packs, so narrow and breathless was  it, with a 
fall  of  a  hundred  and  fifty  feet  beside  them  on  to  sharp  rocks  below;  but  each  of 
them  took a good coil of  rope wound  tight about his waist, and  so at  last without 
mishap they reached the little grassy bay.  
There  they  made  their  third  camp,  hauling  up  what  they  needed  from  below 
with  their ropes. Down  the same way  they were able occasionally  to  lower one of 
the more  active  dwarves,  such  as Kili,  to  exchange  such  news  as  there was,  or  to 
take  a  share  in  the  guard  below,  while  Bofur  was  hauled  up  to  the  higher  camp. 
Bombur would not come up either the rope or the path. 
"I am too fat for such fly-walks," he said. "I should turn dizzy and tread on my 
beard, and then you would be thirteen again. And the knotted ropes are too slender 
for my weight." Luckily for him that was not true, as you will see. 
In  the  meanwhile  some  of  them  explored  the  ledge  beyond  the  opening  and 
found a path  that  led higher and higher on  to  the mountain; but  they did not dare 
to venture very  far  that way, nor was  there much use  in  it. Out up  there  a  silence 
reigned,  broken  by  no  bird  or  sound  except  that  of  the  wind  in  the  crannies  of 
stone. They spoke low and never called or sang, for danger brooded in every rock. 
The  others  who  were  busy  with  the  secret  of  the  door  had  no  more  success. 
They  were  too  eager  to  trouble  about  the  runes  or  the  moon-letters,  but  tried 
without  resting  to  discover where  exactly  in  the  smooth  face  of  the  rock  the  door 
was hidden. They had brought picks and tools of many sorts from Lake-town, and 
at  first  they  tried  to  use  these.  But  when  they  struck  the  stone  the  handles 
splintered and jarred their arms cruelly, and the steel heads broke or bent like lead. 
Mining work,  they  saw  clearly was  no  good  against  the magic  that  had  shut  this 
door; and they grew terrified, too, of the echoing noise. 
Bilbo  found  sitting  on  the  doorstep  lonesome  and  wearisome-there was  not  a 
doorstep, of course, really, but they used to call the little grassy space between the 
wall  and  the  opening  the  "doorstep"  in  fun,  remembering Bilbo's words  long  ago 

####-at  the  unexpected  party  in  his  hobbit-hole,  when  he  said  they  could  sit  on  the 
doorstep  till  they  thought  of  something.  And  sit  and  think  they  did,  or  wandered 
aimlessly about, and glummer and glummer they became. 
Their  spirits  had  risen  a  little  at  the  discovery  of  the path, but now  they  sank 
into their boots; and yet they would not give it up and go away. The hobbit was no 
longer much brighter than the dwarves. He would do nothing but sit with his back 
to  the  rock-face  and  stare  away west  through  the opening, over  the cliff, over  the 
wide  lands  to  the black wall of Mirkwood,  and  to  the distances beyond,  in which 
he  sometimes  thought  he  could  catch  glimpses  of  the Misty Mountains  small  and 
far. If the dwarves asked him what he was doing he answered: 
"You  said  sitting  on  the  doorstep  and  thinking  would  be  my  job,  not  to 
mention  getting  inside,  so  I  am  sitting  and  thinking." But  I  am  afraid  he was  not 
thinking  much  of  the  job,  but  of  what  lay  beyond  the  blue  distance,  the  quiet 
Western Land  and  the Hill  and  his  hobbit-hole under  it. A  large grey  stone  lay  in 
the centre of the grass and he stared moodily at it or watched the great snails. They 
seemed  to  love  the  little  shut-in  bay  with  its  walls  of  cool  rock,  and  there  were 
many of them of huge size crawling slowly and stickily along its sides. 
"Tomorrow begins the last week of Autumn," said Thorin one day.  
"And winter comes after autumn," said Bifur.  
"And  next  year  after  that,"  said  Dwalin,  "and  our  beards  will  grow  till  they 
hang  down  the  cliff  to  the  valley  before  anything  happens  here.  What  is  our 
burglar doing for us? 
Since  he  has  got  an  invisible  ring,  and  ought  to  be  a  specially  excellent 
performer  now,  I  am  beginning  to  think  he might  go  through  the  Front Gate  and 
spy things out a bit!" 
Bilbo  heard  this-the  dwarves  were  on  the  rocks  just  :  above  the  enclosure 
where  he  was  sitting-and  "Good Gracious!"  he  thought,  "so  that  is what  they  are 
beginning  to  think,  is  it?  It  is  always  poor  me  that  has  to  get  them  out  :  of  their 
difficulties, at least since the wizard left. Whatever am I going to do? I might have 
known  that  something  dreadful  would  happen  to  me  in  the  end.  I  don't  think  I 
could bear to see the unhappy valley of Dale again, and as for that steaming gate! 
! !" 
That  night  he  was  very  miserable  and  hardly  slept.  Next  day  the  dwarves  all 
went  wandering  off  in  various  directions;  some  were  exercising  the  ponies  down 
below,  some  were  roving  about  the  mountain-side. All day Bilbo  sat gloomily  in 
the  grassy  bay  gazing  at  the  stone,  or  out  west  through  the  narrow  opening. He 

####-had  a  queer  feeling  that  he  was  waiting  for  something.  "Perhaps  the  wizard  will 
suddenly come back today," he thought. 
If  he  lifted  his  head  he  could  see  a  glimpse  of  the  distant  forest.  As  the  sun 
turned west there was a gleam of yellow upon its far roof, as if the light caught the 
last pale  leaves. Soon he  saw  the orange ball of  the  sun  sinking  towards  the  level 
of his eyes. He went  to  the opening and  there pale and faint was a  thin new moon 
above  the  rim  of Earth. At  that  very moment  he  heard  a  sharp crack behind him. 
There on the grey stone in the grass was an enormous thrush, nearly coal black, its 
pale  yellow  breast  freckled  dark  spots.  Crack!  It  had  caught  a  snail  and  was 
knocking it on the stone. Crack! Crack! 
Suddenly  Bilbo  understood.  Forgetting  all  danger  he  stood  on  the  ledge  and 
hailed  the  dwarves,  shouting  and  paying. Those  that were  nearest  came  tumbling 
over the rocks and as fast as they could along the ledge to him, wondering what on 
earth  was  the  matter;  the  others  shouted  to  be  hauled  up  the  ropes  (except 
Bombur, of course: he was asleep). 
Quickly  Bilbo  explained.  They  all  fell  silent:  the  hobbit  standing  by  the  grey 
stone,  and  the  dwarves with wagging  beards watching  impatiently.  The  sun  sank 
lower  and  lower,  and  their  hopes  fell.  It  sank  into  a  belt  of  reddened  cloud  and 
disappeared.  The  dwarves  groaned,  but  still  Bilbo  stood  almost  without  moving. 
The  little  moon  was  dipping  to  the  horizon.  Evening  was  coming  on.  Then 
suddenly  when  their  hope  was  lowest  a  red  ray  of  the  sun  escaped  like  a  finger 
through  a  rent  in  the  cloud.  A  gleam  of  light  came  straight  through  the  opening 
into  the  bay  and  fell  on  the  smooth  rock-face.  The  old  thrush,  who  had  been 
watching from a high perch with beady eyes and head cocked on one side, gave a 
sudden  trill. There was a  loud attack. A  flake of  rock split  from  the wall and  fell. 
A  hole  appeared  suddenly  about  three  feet  from  the  ground.  Quickly,  trembling 
lest the chance should fade, the dwarves rushed to the rock and pushed-in vain. 
"The key! The key!" cried Bilbo. "Where is Thorin?" 
Thorin hurried up. 
"The key!" shouted Bilbo. "The key that went with the map! Try it now while 
there is still time!" 
Then Thorin stepped up and drew the key on its chain from round his neck. He 
put  it  to  the  hole.  It  fitted  and it turned! Snap! The gleam went out, the sun sank, 
the moon was gone, and evening sprang into the sky.  
Now  they  all  pushed  together,  and  slowly  a  part  of  the  rock-wall  gave  way. 
Long straight cracks appeared and widened. A door five feet high and three broad 
was  out-  lined,  and  slowly  without  a  sound  swung  inwards.  It  seemed  as  if 

####-darkness  flowed  out  like  a  vapour  from  the  hole  in  the  mountain-side,  and  deep 
darkness  in  which  nothing  could  be  seen  lay  before  their  eyes  mouth  leading  in 
and down. 
 

####-<h4>Chapter 12</h4> <br> 

Inside Information 

 
For  a  long  time  the  dwarves  stood  in  the  dark  before  the  door  and  debated, 
until at last Thorin spoke: 
"Now  is  the  time  for  our  esteemed  Mr.  Baggins,  who  has  proved  himself  a 
good  companion  on  our  long  road,  and  a  hobbit  full  of  courage and  resource  far 
exceeding  his  size,  and  if  I may  say  so  possessed  of  good  luck  far  exceeding  the 
usual  allowance-now  is  the  time  for  him  to  perform  the  service  for which  he was 
included in our Company; now is the time for him to earn his Reward." 
You are  familiar with Thorin's style on  important occasions, so  I will not give 
you  any  more  of  it,  though  he  went  on  a  good  deal  longer  than  this.  It  certainly 
was an important occasion, but Bilbo felt impatient. By now he was quite familiar 
with Thorin too, and he knew what be was driving at. 
"If you mean you think it is my job to go into the secret passage first, O Thorin 
Thrain's son Oakenshield, may your beard grow ever longer," he said crossly, "say 
so  at  once  and  have  done!  I  might  refuse.  I  have  got  you  out  of  two  messes 
already,  which  were  hardly  in  the  original  bargain,  so  that  I  am,  I  think,  already 
owed  some  reward.  But  ‘third  time  pays  for  all'  as  my  father  used  to  say,  and 
somehow  I don't  think  I  shall  refuse. Perhaps  I have begun  to  trust my  luck more 
than I used to in the old days" – he meant last spring before he left his own house, 
but  it  seemed  centuries  ago  –  "but  anyway  I  think  I  will  go  and  have  a  peep  at 
once and get it over. Now who is coming with me?" 
He  did  not  expect  a  chorus  of  volunteers, so he was not disappointed. Fili and 
Kili  looked uncomfortable and stood on One  leg, but  the others made no pretence 
of offering  –  except  old Balin.  the  look-out man, who was  rather  fond  the hobbit. 
He  said  he would  come  inside  at  least  and  perhaps  a bit of  the way  too,  really  to 
call for help if necessary.  
The most  that  can  be  said  for  the  dwarves  is  this:  they  intended  to  pay  Bilbo 
really  handsomely  for  his  services;  they  had  brought  him  to  do  a  nasty  job  for 
them,  and  they  did  not  mind  the  poor  little  fellow  doing  it  if  he  would;  but  they 
would  all  have  done  their  best  to  get  him  out  of  trouble,  if  he  got  into  it,  as  they 
did in the case of the trolls at the beginning of their adventures before they had any 
particular  reasons  for  being  grateful  to  him.  There  it  is:  dwarves  are  not  heroes, 
but  calculating  folk with  a great  idea of  the value of money;  some  are  tricky  and 

####-treacherous  and  pretty  bad  lots;  some  are  not,  but  are  decent  enough  people  like 
Thorin and Company, if you don't expect too much. 
 
The  stars  were  coming  out  behind  him  in  a  pale  sky  barred  with  black  when 
the hobbit crept through the enchanted door and stole into the Mountain. It was far 
easier going  than he  expected. This was no goblin  entrance, or  rough wood-elves' 
cave.  It  was  a  passage  made  by  dwarves,  at  the  height  of  their  wealth  and  skill: 
straight  as  a  ruler,  smooth-floored  and  smooth-sided,  going  with  a  gentle  never-
varying slope direct-to some distant end in the blackness below.  
After a while Balin bade Bilbo "Good  luck!" and  stopped where he could still 
see the faint outline of the door, and by a trick of, the echoes of the tunnel hear the 
rustle  of  the whispering  voices  of  the  others  just  outside. Then  the  hobbit  slipped 
on  his  ring,  and warned  by  the  echoes  to  take more  than hobbit's care to make no 
sound,  he  crept  noiselessly  down,  down,  down  into  the  dark.  He  was  trembling 
with  fear,  but  his  little  face  was  set  and  grim.  Already  he  was  a  very  different 
hobbit from the one that had run out without a pocket-handkerchief from Bag-End 
long  ago. He had not had  a pocket-handkerchief for ages. He loosened his dagger 
in its sheath, tightened his belt, and went on. 
 
"Now  you  are  in  for  it  at  last, Bilbo Baggins,"  he  said  to  himself.  "You went 
and put your foot right in it that night of the party, and now you have got to pull it 
out and pay for it! Dear me, what a fool I was and am!" said the least Tookish part 
of  him.  "I  have  absolutely  no  use  for  dragon-guarded treasures, and the whole lot 
could  stay  here  for  ever,  if  only  I  could wake up and  find  this beastly  tunnel was 
my own front-hall at home!" 
He did not wake up of course, but went still on and on, till all sign of the door 
behind  had  faded  away.  He  was  altogether  alone.  Soon  he  thought  it  was 
beginning to feel warm. "Is that a kind of a glow I seem to see coming right ahead 
down  there?"  he  thought.  It was. As  he went  forward  it  grew  and  grew,  till  there 
was no doubt about it. It was a red light steadily getting redder and redder. Also it 
was  now  undoubtedly  hot  in  the  tunnel. Wisps of vapour  floated up and past him 
and he began to sweat. A sound, too, began to throb in his ears, a sort of bubbling 
like  the  noise  of  a  large  pot  galloping  on  the  fire,  mixed  with  a  rumble  as  of  a 
gigantic  tom-cat  purring.  This  grew  to  the  unmistakable  gurgling  noise  of  some 
vast animal snoring in its sleep down there in the red glow in front of him. 
  It  was  at  this  point  that  Bilbo  stopped.  Going  on  from  there  was  the  bravest 
thing he ever did. The tremendous things that happened afterward were as nothing 

####-compared  to  it.  He  fought  the  real  battle  in  the  tunnel  alone,  before  he  ever  saw 
the vast danger that lay in wait. At any rate after a short halt go on he did; and you 
can picture him coming to the end of the tunnel, an opening of much the same size 
and shape as the door above. Through it peeps the hobbit's little head. Before him 
lies the great bottommost cellar or dungeon-hall of the ancient dwarves right at the 
Mountain's  root.  It  is  almost  dark  so  that  its  vastaess  can  only  be  dimly  guessed, 
but  rising  from  the near side of  the  rocky  floor  there  is a great glow. The glow of 
Smaug! 
 
There  he  lay,  a  vast  red-golden dragon, fast asleep;  thrumming came from his 
jaws and nostrils, and wisps of smoke, but his  fires were  low  in slumber. Beneath 
him,  under  all  his  limbs  and  his  huge  coiled  tail,  and  about  him  on  all  sides 
stretching  away  across  the  unseen  floors,  lay  countless  piles  of  precious  things, 
gold wrought and unwrought, gems and jewels, and silver red-stained in the ruddy 
light. 
Smaug  lay, with wings  folded  like  an  immeasurable bat,  turned partly on one 
side,  so  that  the  hobbit  could  see  his  underparts  and  his  long  pale  belly  crusted 
with  gems  and  fragments  of  gold  from  his  long  lying  on  his  costly  bed.  Behind 
him  where  the  walls  were  nearest  could  dimly  be  seen  coats  of  mail,  helms  and 
axes,  swords  and  spears  hanging;  and  there  in  rows  stood  great  jars  and  vessels 
filled with a wealth that could not be guessed. To say that Bilbo's breath was taken 
away  is  no  description  at  all.  There  are  no words  left  to express his  staggerment, 
since Men changed the language that they learned of elves in the days when all the 
world was wonderful.  Bilbo  had  heard  tell  and  sing  of  dragon-hoards before, but 
the splendour, the lust, the glory of such treasure had never yet come home to him. 
His heart was filled and pierced with enchantment and with the desire of dwarves; 
and  he  gazed  motionless,  almost  forgetting  the  frightful  guardian,  at  the  gold 
beyond price and count. 
 
He  gazed  for  what  seemed  an  age,  before  drawn  almost  against  his  will,  he 
stole  from  the  shadow  of  the  doorway,  across  the  floor  to  the  nearest  edge  of  the 
mounds of treasure. Above him the sleeping dragon lay, a dire menace even in his 
sleep.  He  grasped  a  great  two-handled  cup,  as  heavy  as  he  could  carry,  and  cast 
one  fearful  eye  upwards. Smaug  stirred  a wing,  opened  a  claw,  the  rumble  of  his 
snoring changed its note. 
Then  Bilbo  fled.  But  the  dragon  did  not  wake-not  yet  but  shifted  into  other 
dreams  of  greed  and  violence,  lying  there  in  his  stolen  hall while  the  little hobbit 

####-toiled back up  the  long  tunnel. His heart was beating and a more  fevered shaking 
was in his legs than when he was going down, but still he clutched the cup, and his 
chief  thought was:  "I've  done  it! This will  show  them.  'More  like  a grocer  than  a 
burglar' indeed! Well, we'll hear no more of that." 
Nor did he. Balin was overjoyed to see the hobbit again, and as delighted as he 
was  surprised.  He  picked  Bilbo  up  and  carried  him  out  into  the  open  air.  It  was 
midnight  and  clouds  had  covered  the  stars,  but  Bilbo  lay  with  his  eyes  shut, 
gasping  and  taking pleasure  in  the  feel of  the  fresh  air  again,  and hardly noticing 
the  excitement  of  the  dwarves,  or  how  they  praised  him  and  patted  him  on  the 
back  and  put  themselves  and  all  their  families  for  generations  to  come  at  his 
service. 
 
The  dwarves  were  still  passing  the  cup  from  hand  to  hand  and  talking 
delightedly of the recovery of their treasure, when suddenly a vast rumbling woke 
in  the mountain underneath as  if  it was an old volcano  that had made up its mind 
to  start  eruptions  once  again.  The  door  behind  them  was  pulled  nearly  to,  and 
blocked  from  closing  with  a  stone,  but  up  the  long  tunnel  came  the  dreadful 
echoes, from far down in the depths, of a bellowing and a trampling that made the 
ground beneath them tremble. 
Then  the  dwarves  forgot  their  joy  and  their  confident  boasts  of  a  moment 
before  and  cowered  down  in  fright.  Smaug was  still  to  be  reckoned with.  It  does 
not  do  to  leave  a  live  dragon  out  of  your  calculations,  if  you  live  near  him. 
Dragons may  not  have much  real  use  for  all  their wealth,  but  they  know  it  to  an 
ounce as a rule, especially after long possession; and Smaug was no exception. He 
had  passed  from  an  uneasy  dream  (in which  a warrior,  altogether  insignificant  in 
size  but  provided  with  a  bitter  sword  and  great  courage,  figured  most 
unpleasantly)  to  a  doze,  and  from  a  doze  to wide waking.  There was  a  breath  of 
strange  air  in  his  cave.  Could  there  be  a  draught  from  that  little  hole?  He  had 
never  felt  quite  happy  about  it,  though  was  so  small,  and  now  he  glared  at  it  in 
suspicion an wondered why he had never blocked it up. Of late he had half fancied 
he had caught the dim echoes of a knocking sound from far above that came down 
through  it  to  his  lair.  He  stirred  and  stretched  forth  his  neck  to  sniff.  Then  he 
missed the cup!                                       
Thieves!  Fire! Murder!  Such  a  thing  had  not  happened  since  first  he  came  to 
the Mountain! His rage passes description – the sort of rage that is only seen when 
rich  folk  that  have  more  than  they  can  enjoy  suddenly  lose  something  that  they 
have  long  had  but  have  never  before  used  or  wanted.  His  fire  belched  forth,  the 

####-hall  smoked,  he  shook  the mountain-roots. He  thrust his head  in vain  at  the  little 
hole,  and  then  coiling  his  length  together,  roaring  like  thunder  underground,  he 
sped  from  his  deep  lair  through  its  great  door,  out  into  the  huge  passages  of  the 
mountain-palace and up towards the Front Gate. 
To  hunt  the  whole  mountain  till  he  had  caught  the  thief  and  had  torn  and 
trampled  him  was  his  one  thought.  He  issued  from  the  Gate,  the  waters  rose  in 
fierce  whistling  steam,  and  up  he  soared  blazing  into  the  air  and  settled  on  the 
mountain-top  in  a  spout of green  and  scarlet  flame. The dwarves heard  the  awful 
rumour  of  his  flight,  and  they  crouched  against  the  walls  of  the  grassy  terrace 
cringing  under  boulders,  hoping  somehow  to  escape  the  frightful  eyes  of  the 
hunting dragon. 
There they would have all been killed, if it had not been for Bilbo once again. 
"Quick! Quick!" he gasped. "The door! The tunnel! It's no good here." 
Roused  by  these  words  they  were  just  about  to  creep  inside  the  tunnel  when 
Bifur gave a cry: "My cousins! Bombur and Bofur – we have forgotten them, they 
are down in the valley!" 
"They will be slain, and all our ponies too, and all out stores lost," moaned the 
others. "We can do nothing." 
"Nonsense!"  said  Thorin,  recovering  his  dignity.  "We  cannot  leave  them.  Get 
inside Mr. Baggins and Balin, and you two Fili and Kili-the dragon shan't have all 
of us. Now you others, where are the ropes? Be quick!" 
Those  were  perhaps  the  worst  moments  they  had  been  through  yet.  The 
horrible sounds of Smaug's anger were echoing  in  the stony hollows  far above; at 
any  moment  he  might  come  blazing  down  or  fly  whirling  round  and  find  them 
there,  near  the  perilous  cliff's  edge  hauling  madly  on  the  ropes.  Up  came  Bofur, 
and  still  all  was  safe.  Up  came  Bombur,  puffing  and  blowing  while  the  ropes 
creaked, and still all was safe. Up came some tools and bundles of stores, and then 
danger was upon them. A whirring noise was heard. A red light touched the points 
of  standing  rocks.  The  dragon  came.  They  had  barely  time  to  fly  back  to  the 
tunnel, pulling and dragging in their bundles, when Smaug came hurtling from the 
North, licking the mountain-sides with flame, beating his great wings with a noise 
like a roaring wind. His hot breath shrivelled  the grass before  the door, and drove 
in  through  the  crack  they  had  left  and  scorched  them  as  they  lay  hid.  Flickering 
fires  leaped  up  and  black  rock-shadows  danced.  Then  darkness  fell  as  he  passed 
again. 
The ponies screamed with terror, burst their ropes and galloped wildly off. The 
dragon swooped and turned to pursue them, and was gone. 

####-"That'll be the end of our poor beasts!" said Thorin. 
"Nothing  can  escape  Smaug  once  he  sees  it.  Here  we  are  and  here  we  shall 
have to stay, unless any one fancies tramping the long open miles back to the river 
with Smaug on the watch!" 
It  was  not  a  pleasant  thought!  They  crept  further  down  the  tunnel,  and  there 
they  lay  and  shivered  though  it  was  warm  and  stuffy,  until  dawn  came  pale 
through  the  crack  of  the  door. Every  now  and  again  through  the  night  they  could 
hear the roar of the flying dragon grow and then pass and fade, as he hunted round 
and round the mountain-sides. 
He  guessed  from  the  ponies,  and  from  the  traces  of  the  camps  he  had 
discovered,  that men had  come up  from  the  river  and  the  lake  and had  scaled  the 
mountain-side  from  the  valley  where  the  ponies  had  been  standing;  but  the  door 
withstood his searching eye, and the little high-walled bay had kept out his fiercest 
flames.  Long  he  had  hunted  in  vain  till  the  dawn  chilled  his  wrath  and  he  went 
back to his golden couch to sleep – and to gather new strength. 
He would not  forget or  forgive  the  theft, not  if a  thousand years turned him to 
smouldering  stone,  but  he  could  afford  to  wait.  Slow  and  silent  he  crept  back  to 
his lair and half closed his eyes. 
When  morning  came  the  terror  of  the  dwarves  grew  less.  They  realized  that 
dangers  of  this  kind  were  inevitable  in  dealing  with  such  a  guardian,  and  that  it 
was  no  good  giving  up  their  quest  yet.  Nor  could  they  get  away  just  now,  as 
Thorin  had  pointed  out. Their  ponies were  lost  or  killed,  and  they would  have  to 
wait  some  time  before  Smaug  relaxed  his  watch  sufficiently  for  them  to dare  the 
long way on  foot. Luckily  they had  saved  enough of  their  stores  to  last  them  still 
for some time. 
They debated  long on what was  to be done, but  they could  think of no way of 
getting  rid  of  Smaug  –  which  had  always  been  a  weak  point  in  their  plans,  as 
Bilbo  felt  inclined  to  point  out.  Then  as  is  the  nature  of  folk  that  are  thoroughly 
perplexed,  they began  to grumble at  the hobbit, blaming him  for what had at  first 
so pleased them: for bringing away a cup and stirring up Smaug's wrath so soon. 
"What else do you suppose a burglar is to do?" asked Bilbo angrily. "I was not 
engaged  to  kill  dragons,  that  is  warrior's  work,  but  to  steal  treasure.  I  made  the 
best  beginning  I  could.  Did  you  expect  me  to  trot  back  with  the  whole  hoard  of 
Thror  on  my  back?  If  there  is  any  grumbling  to  be  done,  I  think  I  might  have  a 
say. You ought to have brought five hundred burglars not one. I am sure it reflects 
great  credit  on  your  grandfather,  but  you  cannot  pretend  that  you  ever  made  the 

####-vast  extent  of  his  wealth  clear  to me.  I  should want  hundreds  of  years  to  bring  it 
all up, if I was fifty times as big, and Smaug as tame as a rabbit." 
After that of course the dwarves begged his pardon. 
"What  then  do  you  propose  we  should  do,  Mr.  Baggins?"  asked  Thorin 
politely.  
"I  have  no  idea  at  the  moment  –  if  you  mean  about  removing  the  treasure. 
That  obviously  depends  entirely  on  some  new  turn  of  luck  and  the  getting  rid  of 
Smaug. 
Getting  rid  of  dragons  is  not  at  all  in  my  line,  but  I  will  do  my  best  to  think 
about it. Personally I have no hopes at all, and wish I was safe back at home." 
"Never mind that for the moment! What are we to do now,  to-day?" 
"Well,  if  you  really want my  advice,  I  should  say we  can  do  nothing  but  stay 
where  we  are.  By  day  we  can  no  doubt  creep  out  safely  enough  to  take  the  air. 
Perhaps before long one or two could be chosen to go back to the store by the river 
and replenish our supplies. But in the meanwhile everyone ought to be well inside 
the tunnel by night. 
"Now  I  will  make  you  an  offer.  I  have  got my  ring  and will  creep  down  this 
very  noon-then  if  ever  Smaug  ought  to  be  napping-and  see  what  he  is  up  to. 
Perhaps something will turn up. 'Every worm has his weak spot,' as my father used 
to say, though I am sure it was not from personal experience." 
Naturally  the  dwarves  accepted  the  offer  eagerly.  Already  they  had  come  to 
respect little Bilbo. Now he had become the real leader in their adventure. He had 
begun  to  have  ideas  and  plans  of  his  own. When  midday  came  he  got  ready  for 
another  journey  down  into  the Mountain. He  did  not  like  it  of  course,  but  it was 
not  so  bad  now  he  knew, more  or  less, what was  in  front  of  him. Had  he  known 
more about dragons and  their wily ways, he might have  teen more  frightened and 
less hopeful of catching this one napping. 
The sun was shining when he started, but it was as dark as night in the tunnel. 
The light from the door, almost closed, soon faded as he went down. So silent was 
his going  that smoke on a gentle wind could hardly have surpasses  it, and he was 
inclined  to  feel  a  bit  proud  of  himself  as  he  drew  near  the  lower  door. There was 
only the very fainter glow to be seen. 
"Old Smaug  is weary and asleep," he  thought.  "He can't,  see me and he won't 
hear  me.  Cheer  up  Bilbo!"  He  had  forgotten  or  had  never  heard  about  dragons' 
sense of smell. 
It is also an awkward fact that they keep half an eye open watching while they 
sleep,  if  they are  suspicious. Smaug certainly  looked  fast asleep, almost dead and 

####-dark, with scarcely a snore more than a whiff of unseen steam, when Bilbo peeped 
once more from the entrance. He was just about to step out on to the floor when he 
caught  a  sudden  thin  and  piercing  ray  of  red  from  under  the  drooping  lid.  of 
Smaug's  left  eye.  He  was  only  pretending  to  sleep!  He  was  watching  the  tunnel 
entrance!  Hurriedly  Bilbo  stepped  back  and  blessed  the  luck  of  his  ring.  Then 
Smaug spoke. 
 
"Well,  thief!  I  smell  you  and  I  feel  your  air.  I  hear  your  breath. Come  along! 
Help yourself again, there is plenty and to spare!" 
But Bilbo was  not  quite  so  unlearned  in  dragon-lore as all  that, and  if Smaug 
hoped to get him to come nearer so easily he was disappointed. 
"No  thank  you,  O  Smaug  the.  Tremendous!"  he  replied.  "I  did  not  come  for 
presents. I only wished  to have a  look at you and see  if you were  truly as great as 
tales say. I did not believe them." 
"Do  you  now?"  said  the  dragon  somewhat  flattered,  even  though  he  did  not 
believe a word of it.                   j 
"Truly  songs  and  tales  fall  utterly  short  of  the  reality,  O  Smaug  the  Chiefest 
and Greatest of Calamities," replied Bilbo.                                               I 
You  have  nice  manners  for  a  thief  and  a  liar,"  said  the  dragon.  "You  seem 
familiar with my  name,  but  I  don't  seem  to  remember  smelling  you  before. Who 
are you and where do you come from, may I ask?" 
"You  may  indeed!  I  come  from  under  the  hill,  and  under  hills  and  over  the 
hills my paths led. And through the air, I am he that walks unseen." 
"So I can well believe," said Smaug, "but that is hardly our usual name." 
"I am  the clue-finder, the web-cutter, the stinging fly. I as chosen for the lucky 
number." 
"Lovely  titles!"  sneered  the  dragon.  "But  lucky  numbers  don't  always  come 
off." 
"I  am  he  that  buries  his  friends  alive  and  drowns  them  and  draws  them  alive 
again from the water. I came from the end of a bag, but no bag went over me." 
"These don't sound so creditable," scoffed Smaug. 
"I  am  the  friend  of  bears  and  the  guest  of  eagles.  I  am  Ringwinner  and 
Luckwearer;  and  I  am  Barrel-rider," went  on Bilbo  beginning  to  be  pleased with 
his riddling. 
"That's  better!"  said  Smaug.  "But  don't  let  your  imagination  run  away  with 
you!" 
 

####-This  of  course  is  the way  to  talk  to  dragons,  if  you  don't want  to  reveal  your 
proper  name  (which  is  wise),  and  don't  want  to  infuriate  them  by  a  flat  refusal 
(which is also very wise). No dragon can resist the fascination of riddling talk and 
of wasting time trying to understand it. There was a lot here which Smaug did not 
understand  at  all  (though  I  expect  you  do,  since  you  know  all  about  Bilbo's 
adventures  to which  he was  referring), but he  thought he understood enough, and 
he chuckled in his wicked inside. 
"I  thought so  last night," he smiled  to himself. "Lake-men, some nasty scheme 
of those miserable tub-trading Lake-men, or I'm a lizard. I haven't been down that 
way for an age and an age; but I will soon alter that!" 
"Very  well,  O  Barrel-rider!"  he  said  aloud.  "Maybe  Barrel  was  your  pony's 
name;  and maybe  not,  though  it was  fat  enough. You may walk  unseen,  but  you 
did  not  walk  all  the  way.  Let  me  tell  you  I  ate  six  ponies  last  night  and  I  shall 
catch and eat all the others before long. In return for the excellent meal I will give 
you  one  piece  of  advice  for  your  good:  don't  have more  to  do with  dwarves  than 
you can help!" 
"Dwarves!" said Bilbo in pretended surprise. 
"Don't talk to me!" said Smaug. "I know the smell (and taste) of dwarf-no one 
better.  Don't  tell  me  that  I  can  eat  a  dwarf-ridden  pony  and  not  know  it!  You'll 
come  to  a  bad  end,  if  you  go with  such  friends. Thief Barrel-rider. I don't mind if 
you go back and tell them so from me." 
But he did not tell Bilbo that there was one smell he could not make out at all, 
hobbit-smell; it was quite outside his experience and puzzled him mightily.  
"I  suppose  you  got  a  fair  price  for  that  cup  last  night?"  he  went  on.  "Come 
now,  did  you? Nothing  at  all! Well,  that's  just  like  them. And  I  suppose  they  are 
skulking  outside,  and  your  job  is  to  do  all  the  dangerous work  and  get what  you 
can  when  I'm  not  looking-for  them?  And  you  will  get  a  fair  share?  Don't  you 
believe it! If you get off alive, you will be lucky." 
 
Bilbo  was  now  beginning  to  feel  really  uncomfortable.  Whenever  Smaug's 
roving  eye,  seeking  for  him  in  the  shadows,  flashed  across  him,  he  trembled,  and 
an unaccountable desire seized hold of him to rush out and reveal himself and tell 
all  the  truth  to  Smaug.  In  fact  he  was  in  grievous  danger  of  coming  under  the 
dragon-spell. But plucking up courage he spoke again. 
"You  don't  know  everything, O  Smaug  the Mighty,"  said  he.  "Not  gold  alone 
brought us hither." 

####-"Ha! Ha! You  admit  the  'us',"  laughed Smaug. "Why not say  'us fourteen' and 
be  done  with  it.  Mr.  Lucky  Number?  I  am  pleased  to  hear  that  you  had  other 
business  in  these  parts  besides  my  gold.  In  that  case  you  may,  perhaps,  not 
altogether waste your time. 
"I don't know if it has occurred to you that, even if you could steal the gold bit 
by bit-a matter of a hundred years or so – you could not get it very far? Not much 
use  on  the  mountain-side? Not much use  in  the  forest? Bless me! Had you never 
thought  of  the  catch?  A  fourteenth  share,  I  suppose,  Or  something  like  it,  those 
were  the  terms,  eh?  But  what  about  delivery? What  about  cartage? What  about 
armed guards and tolls?" And Smaug laughed aloud. He had a wicked and a wily 
heart,  and  he  knew  his  guesses  were  not  far  out,  though  he  suspected  that  the 
Lake-men were at the back of the plans, and that most of the plunder was meant to 
stop  there  in  the  town  by  the  shore  that  in  his  young  days  had  been  called 
Esgaroth. 
You will hardly believe  it, but poor Bilbo was  really very  taken aback. So far 
all  his.  thoughts  and  energies  had  been  concentrated  on  getting  to  the  Mountain 
and  finding  the  entrance. He  had  never  bothered  to wonder  how  the  treasure was 
to be removed, certainly never how any part of it that might fall to his share was to 
be brought back all the way to Bag-End Under-Hill. 
Now  a  nasty  suspicion  began  to  grow  in  his  mind-had  the  dwarves  forgotten 
this important point too, or were they laughing in their sleeves at him all the time? 
That  is  the effect  that dragon-talk has on the inexperienced. Bilbo of course ought 
to have been on his guard; but Smaug had rather an overwhelming personality.  
"I  tell you," he  said,  in  an  effort  to  remain  loyal  to his  friends  and  to keep his 
end up, "that gold was only an afterthought with  us. We came over hill and under 
hill,  by  wave  and  win,  for  Revenge.  Surely, O  Smaug  the  unassessably wealthy, 
you must realize that your success has made you some bitter enemies?" 
Then  Smaug  really  did  laugh-a  devastating  sound  which  shook  Bilbo  to  the 
floor, while  far  up  in  the  tunnel  the  dwarves  huddled  together  and  imagined  that 
the hobbit had come to a sudden and a nasty end. 
"Revenge!"  he  snorted,  and  the  light  of  his  eyes  lit  the  the  hall  from  floor  to 
ceiling like scarlet lightning. "Revenge! The King under the Mountain is dead and 
where are hi kin  that dare  seek  revenge? Girion Lord of Dale  is dead, and  I have 
eaten  his  people  like  a wolf  among  sheep,  and where  are  his  sons'  sons  that  dare 
approach me?  I  kill where  I wish  and  none  dare  resist.  I  laid  low  the warriors of 
old and their like is not in the world today. Then I was but young and tender. Now 
I  am  old  and  strong,  strong  strong.  Thief  in  the  Shadows!"  he  gloated.  "My 

####-armour  is  like  tenfold shields, my  teeth are swords, my claws spears,  the shock of 
my tail a thunderbolt, my wings a hurricane, and my breath death!" 
"I  have  always  understood,"  said  Bilbo  in  a  frightened  squeak,  "that  dragons 
were softer underneath, especially in the region of the–er–chest; but doubtless one 
so fortified has thought of that." 
The dragon stopped short in his boasting. "Your information is antiquated," he 
snapped.  "I  am  armoured  above  and  below  with  iron  scales  and  hard  gems.  No 
blade can pierce me." 
"I might  have  guessed  it,"  said Bilbo.  "Truly  there  can;  nowhere  be found the 
equal of Lord Smaug the Impenetrable. What magnificence to possess a waistcoat 
of fine diamonds!" 
"Yes,  it  is  rare  and wonderful,  indeed,"  said  Smaug  absurdly  pleased. He  did 
not  know  that  the  hobbit  had  already  caught  a  glimpse  of  his  peculiar  under-
covering on his previous visit, and was itching for a closer view for reasons of his 
own. The dragon rolled over. "Look!" he said. "What do you say to that?" 
"Dazzlingly  marvellous!  Perfect!  Flawless!  Staggering!"  exclaimed  Bilbo 
aloud, but what he thought inside was: "Old fool! Why there is a large patch in the 
hollow of his left breast as bare as a snail out of its shell!" 
After  he  had  seen  that Mr. Baggins'  one  idea was  to  get  away.  "Well,  I  really 
must not detain Your Magnificence any longer," he  said, "or keep you from much 
needed  rest.  Ponies  take  some  catching,  I  believe,  after  a  long  start.  And  so  do 
burglars," he added as a parting shot, as he darted back and fled up the tunnel. 
It was an unfortunate remark, for  the dragon spouted  terrific flames after him, 
and  fast  though  he  sped  up  the  slope,  he  had  not  gone  nearly  far  enough  to  be 
comfortable  before  the  ghastly  head  of  Smaug  was  thrust  against  the  opening 
behind.  Luckily  the  whole  head  and  jaws  could  not  squeeze  in,  but  the  nostrils 
sent  forth  fire  and  vapour  to  pursue  him,  and  he  was  nearly  overcome,  and 
stumbled blindly on in great pain and fear. He had been feeling rather pleased with 
the  cleverness  of  his  conversation  with  Smaug,  but  his  mistake  at  the  end  shook 
him into better sense. 
"Never  laugh  at  live  dragons,  Bilbo  you  fool!"  he  said  to  himself,  and  it 
became  a  favourite  saying  of  his  later,  and  passed  into  a  proverb.  "You  aren't 
nearly through this adventure yet," he added, and that was pretty true as well. 
 
The afternoon was turning into evening when he came out again and stumbled 
and  fell  in  a  faint  on  the  'door-step.'  The  dwarves  revived  him,  and  doctored  his 
scorches  as well  as  they  could; but  it was  a  long  time before  the hair on  the back 

####-of  his  head  and  his  heels  grew  properly  again:  it had  all been  singed  and  frizzled 
right down to the skin. In the meanwhile his friends did their best to cheer him up; 
and they were eager for his story, especially wanting to know why the dragon had 
made such an awful noise, and how Bilbo had escaped. 
But  the  hobbit  was  worried  and  uncomfortable,  and  they  had  difficulty  in 
getting anything out of him. On  thinking  things over he was now  regretting  some 
of the things he had said to the dragon, and was not eager to repeat them. The old 
thrush was sitting on a rock near by with his head cocked on one side, listening to 
all  that was  said.  It  shows what  an  ill  temper Bilbo was  in:  he  picked  up  a  stone 
and threw it at the thrush, which merely fluttered aside and came back. 
"Drat  the  bird!"  said  Bilbo  crossly.  "I  believe  he  is  listening,  and  I  don't  like 
the look of him." 
"Leave  him  alone!"  said Thorin.  "The  thrushes  are  good  and  friendly-this is a 
very  old  bird  indeed,  and  is  maybe  the  last  left  of  the  ancient  breed  that  used  to 
live about here, tame to the hands of my father and grandfather. They were a long-
lived and magical race, and this might even be one of those that were alive then, a 
couple of hundreds years or more ago. The Men of Dale used  to have  the  trick of 
understanding  their  language,  and  used  them  for messengers  to  fly  to  the Men of 
the Lake and elsewhere." 
"Well, he'll have news to take to Lake-town all right, if that is what he is after," 
said Bilbo; "though I don't suppose there are any people left there that trouble with 
thrush-language." 
"Why what has happened?" cried the dwarves. "Do get on with your tale!" 
So  Bilbo  told  them  all  he  could  remember,  and  he  confessed  that  he  had  a 
nasty  feeling  that  the  dragon  guessed  too  much  from  his  riddles  added  to  the 
camps  and  the  ponies.  "I  am  sure  he  knows  we  came  from  Lake-town  and  had 
help  from  there;  and  I  have  a  horrible  feeling  that  his  next  move  may  be  in  that 
direction.  I  wish  to  goodness  I  had  never  said  that  about  Barrel-rider;  it  would 
make even a blind rabbit in these parts think of the Lake-men." 
"Well,  well!  It  cannot  be  helped,  and  it  is  difficult  not  to  slip  in  talking  to  a 
dragon,  or  so  I  have  always  heard,"  said  Balin  anxious  to  comfort  him.  "I  think 
you  did  very well,  if  you  ask me-you found out one very useful thing at any rate, 
and got home alive, and  that  is more  than most can say who have had words with 
the likes of Smaug. It may be a mercy and a blessing yet to know of the bare patch 
in the old Worm's diamond waistcoat." 
That  turned  the  conversation,  and  they  all  began  discussing  dragon-slayings 
historical,  dubious,  and  mythical,  and  the  various  sorts  of  stabs  and  jabs  and 

####-undercuts,  and  the  different  arts,  devices  and  stratagems  by which  they  had  been 
accomplished. The general opinion was that catching a dragon napping was not as 
easy as it sounded, and the attempt to stick one or prod one asleep was more likely 
to  end  in  disaster  than  a  bold  frontal  attack.  All  the  while  they  talked  the  thrush 
listened,  till  at  last when  the  stars  began  to  peep  forth,  it  silently  spread  its wings 
and  flew  away.  And  all  the  while  they  talked  and  the  shadows  lengthened  Bilbo 
became more and more unhappy and his foreboding 
At last he interrupted them. "I am sure we are very unsafe here," he said, "and 
I don't see the point of sitting here. The dragon has withered all the pleasant green, 
and  anyway  the  night  has  come  and  it  is  cold.  But  I  feel  it  in my  bones  that  this 
place will be attacked again. Smaug knows now how I came down to his hall, and 
you  can  trust  him  to  guess where  the  other  end  of  the  tunnel  is. He will break all 
this  side  of  the Mountain  to  bits,  if  necessary,  to  stop  up  our  entrance,  and  if  we 
are smashed with it the better he will like it." 
"You  are  very  gloomy,  Mr.  Baggins!"  said  Thorin.  "Why  has  not  Smaug 
blocked  the  lower  end,  then,  if  he  is  so  eager  to  keep  us  out?  He  has  not,  or  we 
should have heard him." 
"I  don't  know,  I  don't  know-because  at  first  he  wanted  to  try  and  lure  me  in 
again, I suppose, and now perhaps because he is waiting till after tonight's hunt, or 
because he does not want to damage his bedroom if he can help it – but I wish you 
would not argue. Smaug will be coming out at any minute now, and our only hope 
is to get well in the tunnel and shut the door." 
He  seemed  so much  in  earnest  that  the  dwarves  at  last  did  as  he said,  though 
they  delayed  shutting  the  door-it  seemed  a  desperate  plan,  for  no  one  knew 
whether  or  how  they  could  get  it  open  again  from  the  inside,  and  the  thought  of 
being  shut  in  a  place  from  which  the  only  way  out  led  through  the  dragon's  lair 
was  not  one  they  liked.  Also  everything  seemed  quite  quiet,  both  outside  and 
down the tunnel. So for a longish while they sat inside not far down from the half-
open  door  and  went  on  talking.  The  talk  turned  to  the  dragon's  wicked  words 
about the dwarves. Bilbo wished he had never heard them, or at least that he could 
feel quite certain that the dwarves now were absolutely honest when they declared 
that they had never thought at all about what would happen after the treasure had 
been won.  
"We  knew  it  would  be  a  desperate  venture,"  said  Thorin,  "and we  know  that 
still; and I still  think  that when we have won  it will be  time enough  to  think what 
to  do  about  it.  As  for  your  share,  Mr.  Baggins,  I  assure  you  we  are  more  than 
grateful and you shall choose you own fourteenth, as soon as we have anything to 

####-divide, am sorry if you are worried about transport, and I admit the difficulties are 
great-the  lands  have  not  become  less  wild  with  the  passing  of  time,  rather  the 
reverse-but  we  will  do  whatever  we  can  for  you,  and  take  our  share  of  the  cost 
when the time comes. Believe me or not as you like!" 
From that the talk turned to the great hoard itself and to the things that Thorin 
and Balin remembered. They wondered if they were still lying there .unharmed in 
the  hall  below:  the  spears  that  were  made  for  the  armies  of  the  great  King 
Bladorthin  (long  since  dead),  each  had  a  thrice-forged head and  their  shafts were 
inlaid with  cunning gold, but  they were never delivered or paid  for;  shields made 
for warriors long dead; the great golden cup of Thror, two-handed, hammered and 
carven with birds and flowers whose eyes and petals were of jewels; coats of mail 
gilded and silvered and  impenetrable;  the necklace of Girion, Lord of Dale, made 
of five hundred emeralds green as grass, which he gave for the arming of his eldest 
son  in  a  coat  of  dwarf-linked rings the like of which had never been made before, 
for  it  was  wrought  of  pure  silver  to  the  power  and  strength  of  triple  steel.  But 
fairest  of  all  was  the  great  white  gem,  which  the  dwarves  had  found  beneath  the 
roots of the Mountain, the Heart of the Mountain, the Arkenstone of Thrain. 
"The  Arkenstone!  The  Arkenstone!"  murmured  Thorin  in  the  dark,  half 
dreaming with his chin upon his knees. "It was like a globe with a thousand facets; 
it shone like silver in the firelight, like water in the sun, like snow under the stars, 
like rain upon the Moon!" 
But  the enchanted desire of  the hoard had  fallen  from Bilbo. All  through  their 
talk  he  was  only  half  listening  to  them.  He  sat  nearest  to  the  door with  one  ear 
cocked  for  any  beginnings  of  a  sound  without,  his  other  was  alert  or  echoes 
beyond  the  murmurs  of  the  dwarves,  for  any  whisper  of  a  movement  from  far 
below.  
Darkness  grew  deeper  and  he  grew  ever  more  uneasy.  "Shut  the  door!"  he 
begged them. "I fear that dragon in my marrow. I like this silence far less than the 
uproar of last night. Shut the door before it is too late!" 
Something  in  his  voice  gave  the  dwarves  an  uncomfortable  feeling.  Slowly 
Thorin shook off his dreams and getting up he kicked away the stone that wedged 
the door. Then they thrust upon it, and it closed with a snap and a clang. No trace 
of a keyhole was there left on the inside. They were shut in the Mountain! 
And  not  a  moment  too  soon.  They  had  hardly  gone  any  distance  down  the 
tunnel  when  a  blow  smote  the  side  of  the  Mountain  like  the  crash  of  battering-
rams  made  of  forest  oaks  and  swung  by  giants.  The  rock  boomed,  the  walls 
cracked and stones fell from the roof on their heads. What would have happened if 

####-the door had still been open I don't like to think. They fled further down the tunnel 
glad to be still alive, while behind them outside they heard the roar and rumble of 
Smaug's  fury.  He  was  breaking  rocks  to  pieces,  smashing  wall  and  cliff  with  the 
lashings  of  his  huge  tail,  till  their  little  lofty  camping ground,  the  scorched grass, 
the thrush's stone, the snail-covered walls, the narrow ledge, and all disappeared in 
a  jumble  of  smithereens,  and  an  avalanche  of  splintered  stones  fell  over  the  cliff 
into the valley below.  
Smaug  had  left  his  lair  in  silent  stealth,  quietly  soared  into  the  air,  and  then 
floated heavy and slow in the dark like a monstrous crow, down the wind towards 
the  west  of  the  Mountain,  in  the  hopes  of  catching  unawares  something  or 
somebody  there,  and  of  spying  the outlet  to  the passage which  the  thief had used. 
This  was  the  outburst  of  his  wrath  when  he  could  find  nobody  and  see  nothing, 
even where he guessed the outlet must actually be. 
After  he  had  let  off  his  rage  in  this  way  he  felt  better  and  he  thought  in  his 
heart that he would not be troubled again from that direction. In-the meanwhile he 
had further vengeance to take. "Barrel-rider!" he snorted. "Your fee came from the 
waterside  and  up  the water  you  came with  out  a  doubt.  I  don't  know  your  smell, 
but if you are not one of those men of the Lake, you had their help. They shall see 
me and remember who is the real King under the Mountain!" 
He rose in fire and went away south towards the Running River.

Not at Home 

 
In  the  meanwhile,  the  dwarves  sat  in  darkness,  and  utter  silence  fell  about 
them.  Little  they  ate  and  little  they  spoke.  They  could  not  count  the  passing  of 
time; and  they  scarcely dared  to move,  for  the whisper of  their voices echoed and 
rustled in the tunnel. If they dozed, they woke still to darkness and to silence going 
on unbroken. At last after days and days of waiting, as it seemed, when they were 
becoming  choked  and  dazed  for  want  of  air,  they  could  bear  it  no  longer.  They 
would  almost  have  welcomed  sounds  from  below  of  the  dragon's  return.  In  the 
silence  they  feared  some  cunning  devilry  of  his,  but  they  could  not  sit  there  for 
ever. 
Thorin spoke: "Let us  try  the door!" he said. "I must feel  the wind on my face 
soon  or  die.  I  think  I  would  rather  be  smashed  by  Smaug  in  the  open  than 
suffocate in here!" 
So several of the dwarves got up and groped back to where the door had been. 
But  they  found  that  the  upper  end  of  the  tunnel  had  been  shattered  and  blocked 
with broken  rock. Neither key nor  the magic  it had once obeyed would ever  open 
that door again. 
"We are trapped!" they groaned. "This is the end. We shall die here." 
But  somehow,  just  when  the  dwarves  were  most  despairing,  Bilbo  felt  a 
strange  lightening  of  the  heart,  as  if  a  heavy  weight  had  gone  from  under  his 
waistcoat. 
"Come, come!" he  said.  "While  there's  life  there's hope!" as my  father used  to 
say,  and  'Third  time  pays  for  all.'  I  am  going  down  the  tunnel  once  again.  I  have 
been  that  way  twice,  when  I  knew  there  was  a  dragon  at  the  other  end,  so  I  will 
risk  a  third  visit  when  I  am  no  longer  sure.  Anyway  the  only  way  out  is  down. 
And I think time you had better all come with me." 
In desperation they agreed, and Thorin was the first go forward by Bilbo's side. 
"Now  do  be  careful!"  whispered  the  hobbit,  "and  quiet  as  you  can  be! There 
may be no Smaug at the bottom but then again there may be. Don't let us take any 
unnecessary risks!" 
Down,  down  they  went.  The  dwarves  could  not,  course,  compare  with  the 
hobbit  in  real  stealth,  and  the made  a  deal  of  puffing  and  shuffling which  echoes 
magnified alarmingly; but  though every now and again Bilbo  in  fear  stopped and 
listened,  not  a  sound  stirred  below  Near  the  bottom,  as  well  as  he  could  judge, 

####-Bilbo slipped on his ring and went ahead. But he did not need it: the darkness was 
complete,  and  they were  all  invisible,  ring  or  no  ring.  In  fact  so  black was  it  that 
the  hobbit  came  to  the  opening  unexpectedly,  put  his  hand  on  air,  stumbled  for 
ward, and rolled headlong into the hall! 
There he  lay face downwards on  the floor and did no dare  to get up, or hardly 
even  to  breathe.  But  nothing  moved.  There  was  not  a  gleam  of  light-unless,  as 
seemed to him, when at last he slowly raised his head, there was a pale white glint, 
above him and far off in the gloom. But certainly it was not a spark of dragon-fire, 
though the wormstench was heavy in the place, and the taste of vapour was on his 
tongue. 
At length Mr. Baggins could bear it no longer. "Come found you, Smaug, you 
worm!"  he  squeaked  aloud.  "Stop  playing  hide-and-seek!  Give  me  a  light,  and 
then eat me if you can catch me!" 
Faint echoes ran round the unseen hall, but there was no answer. Bilbo got up, 
and found that he did not know in what direction to turn. 
"Now  I  wonder  what  on  earth  Smaug  is  playing  at,"  he  said.  "He  is  not  at 
home  today  (or  tonight, or whatever it is), I do believe. If Oin and Gloin have not 
lost  their  time  tinder-boxes,  perhaps  we  can  make  a  little  light,  and  have  a  look 
round before the luck turns." 
"Light!" he cried. "Can anybody make a light?" 
The  dwarves,  of  course, were  very alarmed when Bilbo fell forward down the 
step with a bump into the hall, and they sat huddled just where he had left them at 
the end the tunnel. 
"Sh!  sh!"  they  hissed,  when  they  heard  his  voice:  and  though  that  helped  the 
hobbit  to  find  out where  they  were, was  some  time  before  he  could  get  anything 
else out of  them. But  in  the end, when Bilbo actually began  to stamp  in  the  floor, 
and  screamed  out  light!'  at  the  top  of  his  thrill  voice,  Thorin  gave  way,  and  Oin 
and Gloin were sent back  to  their bundles  at the top of the tunnel. After a while a 
twinkling  gleam  showed  them  returning,  in  with  a  small  pine-torch  alight  in  his 
hand,  and  Gloin  with  a  bundle  of  others  under  his  arm.  Quickly  Bilbo  trotted  to 
the  door  and  took  the  torch;  but  he  could  not  persuade  the  dwarves  to  light  the 
others  or  to  come  and  join  him  yet.  As  Thorin  carefully  explained,  Mr.  Baggins 
was  still  officially  their  expert  burglar  and  investigator.  If  he  liked  to  risk  a  light, 
that was  his  affair.  They would wait  in  the  tunnel  for  his  report. So  they  sat near 
the door and watched. 
They  saw  the  little  dark  shape  of  the  hobbit  start  across  the  floor  holding  his 
tiny  light aloft. Every now and again, while he was still near enough,  they caught 

####-a  glint  and  a  tinkle  as  he  stumbled  on  some  golden  thing. The  light grew  smaller 
as  he wandered  away  into  the  vast  hall;  then  it  began  to  rise  dancing  into  the  air. 
Bilbo was climbing  the great mound of  treasure. Soon he stood upon  the  top, and 
still  went  on.  Then  they  saw  him  halt  and  stoop  for  a  moment;  but  they  did  not 
know  the  reason.  It  was  the  Arkenstone,  the  Heart  of  the  Mountain.  So  Bilbo 
guessed  from  Thorin's  description;  but  indeed  there  could  not  be  two  such  gems, 
even in so marvellous a hoard, even in all the world. Ever as he climbed, the same 
white gleam had shone before him and drawn his feet towards Slowly it grew to a 
little  globe  of  pallid  light.  Now  as  came  near,  it  was  tinged  with  a  flickering 
sparkle  of man  colours  at  the  surface,  reflected  and  splintered  from  the wavering 
light  of  his  torch.  At  last  he  looked  down  upon  it  and  he  caught  his  breath.  The 
great  jewel  shone before he  feet of  its own  inner  light,  and yet,  cut  and  fashioned 
by  the  dwarves, who  had  dug  it  from  the  heart  of  the mountain  long  ago,  it  took 
all light that fell upon it and-changes it into ten thousand sparks of white radiance 
shot with glints of the rainbow.  
Suddenly  Bilbo's  arm  went  towards  it  drawn  by  it  enchantment.  His  small 
hand  would  not  close  about  it  for  it  was  a  large  and  heavy  gem;  but  he  lifted  it, 
shut his eyes, and put it in his deepest pocket. 
"Now  I  am  a  burglar  indeed!"  thought  he.  "But  I  suppose  I  must  tell  the 
dwarves  about  it-some  time. The  did  say  I  could  pick  and  choose my  own  share; 
and  I  think  I would  choose  this,  if  they  took  all  the  rest!" All  the same he had an 
uncomfortable  feeling  that  the picking and choosing had not  really been meant  to 
include  this marvellous gem, and  that  trouble would yet come of  it. Now he went 
on again. Down the other side of the great mound he climbed, and the spark of his 
torch  vanished  from  the  sight  of  the  watching  dwarves.  But  soon  they  saw  it  far 
away in the distance again. Bilbo was crossing the floor of the hall. 
He  went  on,  until  he  came  to  the  great  doors  at  the  further  side,  and  there  a 
draught  of  air  refreshed him, but  it almost puffed out his  light. He peeped  timidly 
through and caught a glimpse of great passages and of the dim beginnings of wide 
stairs  going  up  into  the  gloom. And  still  there was  no  sight  nor  sound  of  Smaug. 
He was  just  going  to  turn  and  go back, when  a black  shape  swooped  at him  and 
brushed his face. He squeaked and started, stumbled backwards and fell. His torch 
dropped head downwards and went out! 
"Only  a  bat,  I  suppose  and  hope!"  he  said  miserably.  But  now  what  am  I  to 
do? Which is East, South, North West?" 

####-"Thorin! Balin! Oin! Gloin! Fill! Kili!"  he  cried  as  loud  he  could-it seemed a 
thin  little  noise  in  the wide  blackness.  "The  light's  gone  out!  Someone  come  and 
find and help me!" For the moment his courage had failed together.  
Faintly  the  dwarves  heard  his  small  cries,  though  the  only  word  they  could 
catch was 'help!' 
"Now what on earth or under it has happened?" said Thorin. "Certainly not the 
dragon, or he would not go on squeaking." 
They waited a moment or two, and still there were no dragon-noises, no sound 
at  all  in  fact  but  Bilbo's  distant  voice.  "Come,  one  of  you,  get  another  light  or 
two!" Thorin ordered. "It seems we have got to go and help our burglar." 
"It  is  about  our  turn  to  help,"  said  Balin,  "and  I  am  quite  willing  to  go. 
Anyway I expect it is safe for the moment." 
Gloin  lit  several  more  torches,  and  then  they  all  crept  out,  one  by  one,  and 
went  along  the  wall  as  hurriedly  as  they  could.  It  was  not  long  before  they  met 
Bilbo  himself  coming  back  towards  them.  His  wits  had  quickly returned soon as 
he saw the twinkle of their lights. 
"Only  a  bat  and  a  dropped  torch,  nothing  worse!"  he  said  in  answer  to  their 
questions.  Though  they  were  much  relieved,  they  were  inclined  to  be  grumpy  at 
being frightened for nothing; but what they would have said, if he had told them at 
that  moment  about  the  Arkenstone,  I  don't  know.  The  mere  fleeting  glimpses  of 
treasure  which  they  had  caught  as  they  went  along  had  rekindled  all  the  fire  of 
their dwarvish hearts; and when the heart of a dwarf, even the most respectable, is 
wakened  by  gold  and  by  jewels,  he  grows  suddenly  bold,  and  he  may  become 
fierce. 
The  dwarves  indeed  no  longer  needed  any  urging.  All  were  now  eager  to 
explore  the  hall  while  they  had  the  chance,  and  willing  to  believe  that,  for  the 
present,  Smaug  was  away  from  home.  Each  now  gripped  a  lighted  torch;  and  as 
they  gazed,  first  on  one  side  and  then  on  another,  they  forgot  fear  and  even 
caution.  They  spoke  aloud,  and  cried  out  to  one  another,  as  they  lifted  old 
treasures from the mound or from the wall and held them in the light caressing and 
fingering them. Fili and Kili were almost in merry mood, and finding still hanging 
there many  golden  harps  strung with  silver  they  took  them  and  struck  them;  and 
being  magical  (and  also  untouched  by  the  dragon,  who  had  small  interests  in 
music)  they  were  still  in  tune.  The  dark  hall  was  filled  with  a  melody  that  had 
long been silent. But most of the dwarves were more practical; they gathered gems 
and stuffed  their pockets, and  let what  they could  not carry far back through their 
fingers  with  a  sigh.  Thorin  was  not  least  among  these;  but  always  he  searched 

####-from side to side for something which he could not find. It was the Arkenstone but 
he spoke of it yet to no one. 
Now  the  dwarves  took  down  mail  and  weapons  from  the  walls,  and  armed 
themselves. Royal indeed did Thorin look, clad in a coat of gold-plated rings, with 
a silver hafted axe in a belt crusted with scarlet stones. 
"Mr.  Baggins!"  he  cried.  "Here  is  the  first  payment  of  your  reward!  Cast  off 
your old coat and put on this!" 
With  that  he  put  on  Bilbo  a  small  coat  of mail,  wrought  for  some  young  elf-
prince long ago. It was of silver-steel which the elves call mithril, and with it went 
a belt of pearls and crystals. A  light helm of  figured  leather, strengthened beneath 
with hoops of steel, and studded about the bring with white gems, was set upon the 
hobbit's head. 
"I  feel magnificent," he  thought;  "but  I expect  I  look  rather absurd. How  they 
would laugh on the Hill at home Still I wish there was a looking-glass handy!" 
All  the  same Mr. Baggins  kept  his  head more  clear  of  the  bewitchment  of  the 
hoard  than  the dwarves did. Long before  the dwarves were  tired of examining  the 
treasures he became wary of it and sat down on the floor; and he began to wonder 
nervously what the end of it all would be 
"I would give a good many of  these precious goblets,    thought, "for a drink of 
something cheering out of one Beorn's wooden bowls!" 
"Thorin!"  he  cried  aloud.  "What  next? We  are  armed,  but what  good  has  any 
armour ever been before against Smaug the Dreadful? This treasure is not yet won 
back.  We  are  not  looking  for  gold  yet,  but  for  a  way  of  escape;  and  we  have 
tempted luck too long!" 
'"You speak the truth!" answered Thorin, recovering his wits. "Let us go! I will 
guide you. Not  in a  thousand years should  I  forget  the ways of  this palace." Then 
he  hailed  the  others,  and  they  gathered  together,  and  holding  their  torches  above 
their  heads  they  passed  through  the  gaping  doors,  not  without many  a  backward 
glance of longing. 
Their  glittering  mail  they  had  covered  again  with  their  old  cloaks  and  their 
bright helms with their tattered hoods, and one by one they walked behind Thorin, 
a  line  of  little  lights  in  the  darkness  that  halted  often,  listening  in  fear  once more 
for any  rumour of  the dragon's coming. Though all  the old adornments were  long 
mouldered  or  destroyed,  and  though  all  was  befouled  and  blasted  with  the 
comings  and  goings  of  the  monster,  Thorin  knew  every  passage  and  every  turn. 
They  climbed  long  stairs,  and  turned  and  went  down  wide  echoing  ways,  and 
turned again and climbed yet more stairs, and yet more' stairs again. 

####-These were  smooth,  cut  out  of  the  living  rock  broad  and  lair;  and  up,  up,  the 
dwarves went, and  they met no sign of any  living  thing, only furtive shadows that 
fled  from  the  approach  of  their  torches  fluttering  in  the  draughts.  The  steps were 
not made, all the same, for hobbit-legs, and Bilbo was just feeling that he could go 
on no longer, when suddenly the roof sprang high and far beyond the reach of their 
torch-light.  A  white  glimmer  could  be  seen  coming  through  some  opening  far 
above,  and  the  air  smelt  sweeter.  Before  them  light  came  dimly  through  great 
doors, that hung twisted on their hinges and half burnt. 
"This  is  the  great  chamber  of Thror,"  said Thorin; "the hall of  feasting and of 
council. Not far off now is the Front Gate." 
They passed through the ruined chamber. Tables were rotting there; chairs and 
benches were lying there overturned, charred and decaying. Skulls and bones were 
upon  the  floor  among  flagons  and  bowls  and  broken  drinking-horns and dust. As 
they  came  through  yet more  doors  at  the  further  end,  a  sound  of  water  fell  upon 
their ears, and the grey light grew suddenly more full. 
"There is the birth of the Running River," said Thorin. "From here it hastens to 
the Gate. Let us follow it!" 
Out  of  a  dark  opening  in  a  wall  of  rock  there  issued  a  boiling  water,  and  it 
flowed  swirling  in  a  narrow  channel,  carved  and  made  straight  and  deep  by  the 
cunning of ancient hands. Beside it ran a stone-paved road, wide enough for many 
men  abreast.  Swiftly  along  this  they  ran,  and  round  a  wide-sweeping  turn-and 
behold!  before  them  stood  the  broad  light  of  day.  In  front  there  rose  a  tall  arch, 
still  showing  the  fragments  of  old  carven  work  within,  worn  and  splintered  and 
blackened  though  it was. A misty  sun  sent  its  pale  light  between  the  arms  of  the 
Mountain, and beams of gold fell on the pavement at the threshold. 
A whirl of bats frightened from slumber by their smoking torches flurried over 
them;  as  they  sprang  forward  their  feet  slithered  on  stones  rubbed  smooth  and 
slimed  by  the  passing  of  the  dragon.  Now  before  them  the  water  fell  noisily 
outward and foamed down towards the valley. They flung their pale torches to the 
ground,  and  stood  gazing  out  with  dazzled  eyes.  They  were  come  to  the  Front 
Gate, and were looking out upon Dale. 
"Well!"  said  Bilbo,  "I  never  expected  to  be  looking  out  of  this  door.  And  I 
never  expected  to  be  so  pleased  to  see  the  sun  again,  and  to  feel  the wind  on my 
face. But, ow! this wind is cold!" 
It  was.  A  bitter  easterly  breeze  blew  with  a  threat  of  oncoming  winter.  It 
swirled  over  and  round  the  arms  of  the  Mountain  into  the  valley,  and  sighed 
among the rocks. After their long time in the stewing depths of the dragon-haunted 

####-caverns,  they  shivered  in  the  sun.  Suddenly  Bilbo  realized  that  he  was  not  only 
tired but also very hungry indeed. "It seems to be late morning," he said, "and so I 
suppose  it  is more  or  less  breakfast-time  –  if  there  is any breakfast  to have. But  I 
don't  feel  that  Smaug's  front  doorstep  is  the  safest  place  for  a  meal.  Do  let's  go 
somewhere where we can sit quiet for a bit!" 
"Quite  right!"  said  Balin.  "And  I  think  I  know  which  way  we  should  go:  we 
ought to make for the old look-out post at the Southwest corner of the Mountain." 
"How far is that?" asked the hobbit. 
"Five  hours march,  I  should  think.  It will  be  rough  going.  The  road  from  the 
Gate along  the  left edge of  the  stream  seems all broken up. But  look down  there! 
The river loops suddenly east across Dale in front of the ruined town. At that point 
there was once a bridge, leading to steep stairs that climbed up the right bank, and 
so to a road running towards Ravenhill. There is (or was) a path that left the road 
and climbed up to the post. A hard climb, too, even if the old steps are still there." 
"Dear  me!"  grumbled  the  hobbit.  "More  walking  and  more  climbing  without 
breakfast! I wonder how many breakfasts, and other meals, we have missed inside 
that nasty clockless, timeless hole?" 
As  a  matter  of  fact  two  nights  and  the  day  between  had  gone  by  (and  not 
altogether without  food)  since  the dragon  smashed  the magic door, but Bilbo had 
quite  lost  count,  and  it  might  have  been  one  night  or  a  week  of  nights  for  all  he 
could tell. 
"Come, come!" said Thorin  laughing – his spirits had begun to rise again, and 
he  rattled  the  precious  stones  in  his  pockets.  "Don't  call  my  place  a  nasty  hole! 
You wait till it has been cleaned and redecorated!" 
"That won't be till Smaug's dead," said Bilbo glumly. "In the meanwhile where 
is he? I would give a good breakfast to know. I hope he is not up on the Mountain 
looking down at us!" 
 
That idea disturbed the dwarves mightily, and they quickly decided that Bilbo 
and Balin were right. 
"We must move  away  from  here,"  said Don.  "I  feel  as  if his  eyes were on  the 
back of my head." 
"It's  a  cold  lonesome  place,"  said Bombur.  "There may  be  drink,  but  I  see  no 
sign of food. A dragon would always be hungry in such parts." 
"Come on! Come on!" cried the others. "Let us follow Balm's path!" 
Under the rocky wall to the right there was no path, so on they trudged among 
the  stones  on  the  left  side  of  the  river,  and  the  emptiness  and  desolation  soon 

####-sobered  even Thorin  again. The  bridge  that Balin  had  spoken  of  they  found  long 
fallen, and most of its stones were now only boulders in the shallow noisy stream; 
but they forded the water without much difficulty, and found the ancient steps, and 
climbed  the  high  bank.  After  going  a  short  way  they  struck  the  old  road,  and 
before  long  came  to  a  deep  dell sheltered among  the rocks;  there  they rested for a 
while and had such a breakfast as they could, chiefly cram and water. (If you want 
to  know  what  cram  is,  I  can  only  say  that  I  don't  know  the  recipe;  but  it  is 
biscuitish,  keeps  good  indefinitely,  is  supposed  to  be  sustaining,  and  is  certainly 
not  entertaining,  being  in  fact  very  uninteresting  except  as  a  chewing  exercise.  It 
was made by the Lake-men for long journeys). 
After  that  they went on again; and now  the road struck westwards and  left  the 
river, and the great shoulder of the south-pointing mountain-spur drew ever nearer. 
At  length  they  reached  the  hill  path.  It  scrambled  steeply  up,  and  they  plodded 
slowly one behind the other, till at last in the late afternoon they came to the top of 
the ridge and saw the wintry sun going downwards to the West. 
Here  they  found  a  flat  place  without  a  wall  on  three  sides,  but  backed  to  the 
North by a  rocky  face  in which  there was an opening  like a door. From  that door 
there was a wide view East and South and West. 
"Here,"  said  Balin,  "in  the  old  days  we  used  always  to  keep  watchmen,  and 
that  door  behind  leads  into  a  rock-hewn  chamber  that  was  made  here  as  a 
guardroom.  There  were  several  places  like  it  round  the  Mountain.  But  there 
seemed small need for watching in the days of our prosperity, and the guards were 
made  over  comfortable,  perhaps  – otherwise we might have had  longer warnings 
of  the coming of  the dragon, and  things might have been different. Still,  "here we 
can now lie hid and sheltered for a while, and can see much without being seen." 
"Not much use, if we have been seen coming here," said Dori, who was always 
looking  up  towards  the Mountain's  peak,  as  if  he  expected  to  see Smaug  perched 
there like a bird on a steeple. 
"We must take our chance of that," said Thorin. "We can go no further to-day." 
"Hear, hear!" cried Bilbo, and flung himself on the ground. 
In the rock-chamber there would have been room for a hundred, and there was 
a  small  chamber  further  in,  more  removed  from  the  cold  outside.  It  was  quite 
deserted; not even wild animals seemed  to have used  it  in all  the days of Smaug's 
dominion. There they laid their burdens; and some threw themselves down at once 
and slept, but the others sat near the outer door and discussed their plans. 
In  all  their  talk  they  came  perpetually  back  to  one  thing: where was  Smaug? 
They  looked West  and  there was  nothing,  and  East  there was  nothing,  and  in  the 

####-South  there  was  no  sign  of  the  dragon,  but  there  was  a  gathering  of  very  many 
birds. At  that  they gazed and wondered; but they were no nearer understanding it, 
when the first cold stars came out. 

####-<h4>Chapter 14</h4> <br> 

Fire and Water 

 
Now  if you wish,  like  the dwarves,  to hear news of Smaug, you must go back 
again  to  the  evening  when  he  smashed  the  door  and  flew  off  in  rage,  two  days 
before. 
The  men  of  the  lake-town  Esgaroth  were  mostly  indoors,  for  the  breeze  was 
from the black East and chill, but a few were walking on the quays, and watching, 
as they were fond of doing, the stars shine out from the smooth patches of the lake 
as  they  opened  in  the  sky.  From  their  town  the  Lonely  Mountain  was  mostly 
screened  by  the  low  hills  at  the  far  end  of  the  lake,  through  a  gap  in  which  the 
Running  River  came  down  from  the North. Only  its  high  peak  could  they  see  in 
clear weather, and they looked seldom at it, for it was ominous and dreary even in 
the light of morning. Now it was lost and gone, blotted in the dark. 
Suddenly it flickered back to view; a brief glow touched it and faded. 
"Look!"  said  one.  "The  lights  again!  Last  night  the watchmen  saw  them start 
and fade from midnight until dawn. Something is happening up there." 
"Perhaps  the  King  under  the  Mountain  is  forging  gold,"  said  another.  "It  is 
long since he went north. It is time the songs began to prove themselves again." 
"Which  king?"  said  another  with  a  grim  voice.  "As  like  as  not  it  is  the 
marauding  fire  of  the  Dragon,  the  only  king  under  the  Mountain  we  have  ever 
known." 
"You  are  always  foreboding  gloomy  things!"  said  the  others.  "Anything  from 
floods to poisoned fish. Think of something cheerful!" 
Then  suddenly  a  great  light  appeared  in  the  low  place  in  the  hills  and  the 
northern end of the lake turned golden. 
"The King  beneath  the Mountain!"  they  shouted.  "His wealth  is  like  the  Sun, 
his silver like a fountain, his rivers golden run! The  river is running gold from the 
Mountain!"  they  cried,  and  everywhere  windows  were  opening  and  feet  were 
hurrying. 
There was once more a  tremendous excitement and enthusiasm. But  the grim-
voiced fellow ran hotfoot to the Master. "The dragon is coming or I am a fool!" he 
cried. "Cut the bridges! To arms! To arms!" 
Then  warning  trumpets  were  suddenly  sounded,  and  echoed  along  the  rocky 
shores.  The  cheering  stopped  and  the  joy was  turned  to  dread.  So  it was  that  the 
dragon  did  not  find  them  quite  unprepared.  Before  long,  so  great was  his  speed, 

####-they  could  see  him  as  a  spark  of  fire  rushing  towards  them  and  growing  ever 
huger  and more  bright,  and  not  the most  foolish  doubted  that  the  prophecies  had 
gone  rather wrong. Still  they had a  little  time. Every vessel  in  the town was filled 
with  water,  every  warrior  was  armed,  every  arrow  and  dart  was  ready,  and  the 
bridge  to  the  land  was  thrown  down  and  destroyed,  before  the  roar  of  Smaug's 
terrible  approach  grew  loud,  and  the  lake  rippled  red  as  fire  beneath  the  awful 
beating of his wings. 
Amid  shrieks  and  wailing  and  the  shouts  of  men  he  came  over  them,  swept 
towards the bridges and was foiled! The bridge was gone, and his enemies were on 
an  island  in  deep  water-too  deep  and  dark  and  cool  for  his  liking.  If  he  plunged 
into  it, a vapour and a steam would arise enough  to cover all  the  land with a mist 
for days; but  the  lake was mightier  than he,  it would quench him before he could 
pass through. 
Roaring  he  swept  back  over  the  town.  A  hail  of  dark  arrows  leaped  up  and 
snapped and  rattled on his  scales and  jewels, and  their  shafts  fell back kindled by 
his  breath  burning  and  hissing  into  the  lake.  No  fireworks  you  ever  imagined 
equalled the sights that night. At the twanging of the bows and the shrilling of the 
trumpets  the  dragon's wrath blazed to its height, till he was blind and mad with it. 
No  one  had  dared  to  give  battle  to  him  for  many  an  age;  nor  would  they  have 
dared  now,  if  it  had  not  been  for  the  grim-voiced man  (Bard was his name), who 
ran to and fro cheering on the archers and urging the Master to order them to fight 
to the last arrow.  
Fire leaped from the dragon's jaws. He circled for a while high in the air above 
them lighting all the lake; the trees by the shores shone like copper and like blood 
with  leaping shadows of dense black at their feet. Then down he swooped straight 
through  the  arrow-storm,  reckless  in  his  rage,  taking  no  heed  to  turn  his  scaly 
sides towards his foes, seeking only to set their town ablaze. 
Fire  leaped  from  thatched  roofs  and  wooden  beam-ends  as  he  hurtled  down 
and  past  and  round  again,  though  all  had  been  drenched  with  water  before  he 
came. Once more water was flung by a hundred hands wherever a spark appeared. 
Back  swirled  the  dragon.  A  sweep  of  his  tail  and  the  roof  of  the  Great  House 
crumbled  and  smashed  down.  Flames  unquenchable  sprang  high  into  the  night. 
Another  swoop and another, and another house and  then another  sprang afire and 
fell;  and  still  no  arrow  hindered  Smaug  or  hurt  him  more  than  a  fly  from  the 
marshes.  Already  men  were  jumping  into  the  water  on  every  side.  Women  and 
children  were  being  huddled  into  laden  boats  in  the  market-pool. Weapons were 
flung down. There was mourning and weeping, where but a little time ago the old 

####-songs  of mirth  to  come  had  been  sung  about  the  dwarves. Now men cursed  their 
names.  The  Master  himself  was  turning  to  his  great  gilded  boat,  hoping  to  row 
away  in  the confusion and save himself. Soon all  the  town would be deserted and 
burned down to the surface of the lake. That was the dragon's hope. They could all 
get  into  boats  for  all  he  cared.  There  he  could  have  fine  sport  hunting  them,  or 
they could stop till they starved. Let them try to get to land and he would be ready. 
Soon  he  would  set  all  the  shoreland  woods  ablaze  and  wither  every  field  and 
pasture.  Just  now  he  was  enjoying  the  sport  of  town-baiting  more  than  he  had 
enjoyed anything for years. But there was still a company of archers that held their 
ground among the burning houses. Their captain was Bard, grim-voiced and grim-
faced,  whose  friends  had  accused  him  of  prophesying  floods  and  poisoned  fish, 
though  they  knew  his  worth  and  courage.  He  was  a  descendant  in  long  line  of 
Girion, Lord of Dale, whose wife and child had escaped down  the Running River 
from  the  ruin  long  ago. Now  he  shot with  a  great yew bow,  till all his arrows but 
one were spent. The flames were near him. His companions were leaving him. He 
bent his bow for  the  last  time. Suddenly out of  the dark something fluttered  to his 
shoulder.  He  started-but  it was  only  an  old  thrush. Unafraid  it perched by his ear 
and it brought him news. Marvelling he found he could understand its tongue, for 
he was of the race of Dale. 
"Wait! Wait!"  it  said  to  him.  "The moon  is  rising.  Look  for  the  hollow  of  the 
left  breast  as  he  flies  and  turns  above  you!" And while Bard paused  in wonder  it 
told  him  of  tidings  up  in  the  Mountain  and  of  all  that  it  had  heard.  Then  Bard 
drew his bow-string to his ear. The dragon was circling back, flying low, and as he 
came the moon rose above the eastern shore and silvered his great wings. 
"Arrow!"  said  the  bowman.  "Black  arrow!  I  have  saved  you  to  the  last.  You 
have never  failed me and always  I have  recovered you.  I had you  from my  father 
and  he  from  of  old.  If  ever  you  came  from  the  forges  of  the  true  king  under  the 
Mountain, go now and speed well!" 
The  dragon  swooped  once more  lower  than  ever,  and  as  he  turned  and  dived 
down his belly glittered white with  sparkling  fires of gems  in  the moon-but not in 
one place. The great bow  twanged. The black arrow sped straight from  the string, 
straight  for  the  hollow  by  the  left  breast  where  the  foreleg  was  flung  wide.  In  it 
smote and vanished, barb, shaft and  feather, so  fierce was  its  flight. With a shriek 
that  deafened men,  felled  trees  and  split  stone,  Smaug  shot  spouting  into  the  air, 
turned over and crashed down from on high in ruin. 
Full on  the  town he  fell. His  last  throes splintered  it  to sparks and gledes. The 
lake roared  in. A vast steam  leaped up, white  in  the sudden dark under  the moon. 

####-There  was  a  hiss,  a  gushing  whirl,  and  then  silence.  And  that  was  the  end  of 
Smaug  and  Esgaroth,  but  not  of  Bard.  The waxing moon  rose  higher  and  higher 
and the wind grew loud and cold. It twisted the white fog into bending pillars and 
hurrying  clouds  and  drove  it  off  to  the West  to  scatter  in  tattered  shreds over  the 
marshes before Mirkwood. Then the many boats could be seen dotted dark on the 
surface of  the  lake, and down  the wind came  the voices of  the people of Esgaroth 
lamenting  their  lost  town and goods and  ruined houses. But  they had  really much 
to be  thankful  for, had  they  thought of  it,  though  it  could hardly be  expected  that 
they should just then: three quarters of the people of the town had at least escaped 
alive;  their  woods  and  fields  and  pastures  and  cattle  and  most  of  their  boats 
remained undamaged; and the dragon was dead. What that meant they had not yet 
realized. 
They  gathered  in  mournful  crowds  upon  the  western  shores,  shivering  in  the 
cold wind,  and  their  first  complaints  and  anger were  against  the Master, who had 
left the town so soon, while some were still willing to defend it. 
"He  may  have  a  good  head  for  business-especially  his  own  business,"  some 
murmured, "but he  is no good when anything serious happens!" And  they praised 
the courage of Bard and his last mighty shot. "If only he had not been killed," they 
all  said,  "we  would  make  him  a  king.  Bard  the  Dragon-shooter  of  the  line  of 
Girion! Alas that he is lost!" 
And  in  the very midst of  their  talk, a  tall figure stepped from  the shadows. He 
was drenched with water, his black hair hung wet over his face and shoulders, and 
a fierce light was in his eyes. 
"Bard  is  not  lost!"  he  cried.  "He  dived  from  Esgaroth,  when  the  enemy  was 
slain. I am Bard, of the line of Girion; I am the slayer of the dragon!" 
"King  Bard!  King  Bard!"  they  shouted;  but  the Master  ground  his  chattering 
teeth. 
"Girion was lord of Dale, not king of Esgaroth," he said. "In the Lake-town we 
have  always  elected masters  from  among  the old  and wise,  and have not  endured 
the rule of mere fighting men. Let 'King Bard' go back to his own kingdom-Dale is 
now freed by his valour, and nothing binders his return. And any that wish can go 
with  him,  if  they  prefer  the  cold  shores  under  the  shadow  of  the Mountain  to  the 
green shores of the lake. The wise will stay here and hope to rebuild our town, and 
enjoy again in time its peace and riches." 
"We will have King Bard!" the people near at hand shouted in reply. "We have 
had  enough  of  the  old men  and  the money-counters!" And people further off took 

####-up the cry: "Up the Bowman, and down with Moneybags," till the clamour echoed 
along the shore. 
"I  am  the  last man  to  undervalue  Bard  the  Bowman,"  said  the Master warily 
(for Bard now stood close beside him). "He has tonight earned an eminent place in 
the  roll  of  the  benefactors  of  our  town;  and  he  is  worthy  of  many  imperishable 
songs.  But,  why  O  People?"-and  here  the Master  rose  to  his  feet  and  spoke  very 
loud and clear – "why do I get all your blame? For what fault am I to be deposed? 
Who  aroused  the  dragon  from  his  slumber,  I might  ask? Who obtained of us rich 
gifts  and  ample  help,  and  led  us  to  believe  that  old  songs  could  come  true? Who 
played  on  our  soft  hearts  and  our  pleasant  fancies? What  sort  of  gold  have  they 
sent  down  the  river  to  reward  us?  Dragon-fire  and  ruin!  From  whom  should we 
claim the recompense of our damage, and aid for our widows and orphans?" 
As  you  see,  the Master  had  not  got  his  position  for  nothing.  The  result  of  his 
words  was  that  for  the  moment  the  people  quite  forgot  their  idea  of  a  new  king, 
and  turned  their angry  thoughts  towards Thorin and his company. Wild and bitter 
words were shouted from many sides; and some of those who had before sung the 
old  songs  loudest,  were  now  heard  as  loudly  crying  that  the  dwarves  had  stirred 
the dragon up against them deliberately! 
"Fools!" said Bard. "Why waste words and wrath on those unhappy creatures? 
Doubtless  they  perished  first  in  fire,  before  Smaug  came  to  us."  Then  even  as  he 
was  speaking,  the  thought  came  into  his  heart  of  the  fabled  treasure  of  the 
Mountain lying without guard or owner, and he fell suddenly silent. He thought of 
the Master's  words,  and  of  Dale  rebuilt,  and  filled  with  golden  bells,  if  he  could 
but find the men. 
At  length  he  spoke  again:  "This  is  no  time  for  angry  words.  Master,  or  for 
considering weighty plans of change. There is work to do. I serve you still-though 
after  a  while  I  may  think  again  of  your  words  and  go  North  with  any  that  will 
follow me." 
Then  he  strode  off  to  help  in  the  ordering  of  the  camps  and  in  the  care  of  the 
sick  and  the  wounded.  But  the  Master  scowled  at  his  back  as  he  went,  and 
remained  sitting  on  the  ground. He  thought much  but  said  little,  unless  it was  to 
call  loudly  for  men  to  bring  him  fire  and  food.  Now  everywhere  Bard  went  he 
found  talk  running  like  fire  among  the  people  concerning  the  vast  treasure  that 
was  now  unguarded.  Men  spoke  of  the  recompense  for  all  their  harm  that  they 
would soon get from it, and wealth over and to spare with which to buy rich things 
from  the  South;  and  it  cheered  them  greatly  in  their  plight.  That was as well,  for 
the night was bitter and miserable. Shelters could be contrived for few (the Master 

####-had one)  and  there was  little  food  (even  the Master went  short). Many  took  ill of 
wet  and  cold  and  sorrow  that  night,  and  afterwards  died,  who  had  escaped 
uninjured from the ruin of the town; and in the days that followed there was much 
sickness and great hunger.  
Meanwhile  Bard  took  the  lead,  and  ordered  things  as  he  wished,  though 
always  in  the  Master's  name,  and  he  had  a  hard  task  to  govern  the  people  and 
direct  the  preparations  for  their  protection  and  housing.  Probably  most  of  them 
would  have  perished  in  the winter  that  now  hurried  after  autumn,  if  help  had  not 
been to hand. But help came swiftly; for Bard at once had speedy messengers sent 
up  the  river  to  the Forest  to ask  the aid of  the King of  the Elves of  the Wood, and 
these messengers had found a host already on the move, although it was then only 
the third day after the fall of Smaug. 
The Elvenking had received news from his own messengers and from the birds 
that  loved  his  folk,  and  already  knew  much  of  what  had  happened.  Very  great 
indeed was  the commotion among all  things with wings  that dwelt on  the borders 
of  the Desolation of  the Dragon. The  air was  filled with  circling  flocks,  and  their 
swift-flying messengers  flew  here  and  there  across  the  sky.  Above  the  borders  of 
the  Forest  there  was  whistling,  crying  and  piping.  Far  over  Mirkwood  tidings 
spread: "Smaug is dead!" Leaves rustled and startled ears were lifted. Even before 
the  Elvenking  rode  forth  the  news  had  passed west  right  to  the  pinewoods  of  the 
Misty Mountains; Beorn had heard it in his wooden house, and the goblins were at 
council in their caves. 
"That  will  be  the  last  we  shall  hear  of  Thorin  Oakenshield,  I  fear,"  said  the 
king. "He would have done better to have remained my guest. It is an ill wind, all 
the  same,"  he  added,  "that  blows  no  one  any  good."  For  he  too  had  not  forgotten 
the legend of the wealth of Thror. So it was that Bard's messengers found him now 
marching  with  many  spearmen  and  bowmen;  and  crows  were  gathered  thick, 
above him,  for  they  thought  that war was awakening again,  such as had not been 
in  those parts  for a  long age. But  the king, when he  received  the prayers of Bard, 
had  pity,  for  he  was  the  lord  of  a  good  and  kindly  people;  so  turning  his march, 
which  had  at  first  been  direct  towards  the  Mountain,  he  hastened  now  down  the 
river  to  the  Long  Lake.  He  had  not  boats  or  rafts  enough  for  his  host,  and  they 
were  forced  to  go  the  slower way  by  foot;  but  great  store  of  goods he sent ahead 
by water. Still elves are light–footed, and though they were not in these days much 
used  to  the  marches  and  the  treacherous  lands  between  the  Forest  and  the  Lake, 
their going was swift. Only five days after the death of the dragon they came upon 
the  shores and  looked on  the  ruins of  the  town. Their welcome was good, as may 

####-be expected, and the men and their Master were ready to make any bargain for the 
future in return for the Elvenking's aid. 
Their plans were soon made. With the women and the children, the old and the 
unfit,  the  Master  remained  behind;  and  with  him  were  some  men  of  crafts  and 
many  skilled  elves;  and  they  busied  themselves  felling  trees,  and  collecting  the 
timber  sent  down  from  the  Forest.  Then  they  set  about  raising  many  huts  by  the 
shore  against  the  oncoming  winter;  and  also  under  the  Master's  direction  they 
began  the planning of a new  town, designed more fair and  large even  than before, 
but not  in  the  same place. They  removed northward higher up  the  shore;  for  ever 
after  they  had  a  dread  of  the  water  where  the  dragon  lay.  He  would  never  again 
return to his golden bed, but was stretched cold as stone, twisted upon the floor of 
the  shallows.  There  for  ages  his  huge  bones  could  be  seen  in  calm weather  amid 
the  ruined  piles  of  the old  town. But  few dared  to cross  the cursed spot, and none 
dared  to dive  into  the shivering water or recover  the precious stones  that fell from 
his rotting carcass. 
But  all  the men  of  arms  who  were  still  able,  and  the most  of  the  Elvenking's 
array,  got  ready  to march  north  to  the Mountain.  It  was  thus  that  in  eleven  days 
from the ruin of the town the head of their host passed the rock-gates at the end of 
the lake and came into the desolate lands.

The Gathering of the Clouds 

 
Now  we  will  return  to  Bilbo  and  the  dwarves.  All  night  one  of  them  had 
watched,  but when morning  came  they  had  not  heard  or  seen  any  sign  of  danger. 
But ever more thickly the birds were gathering. Their companies came flying from 
the  South;  and  the  crows  that  still  lived  about  the Mountain  were  wheeling  and 
crying unceasingly above. 
"Something  strange  is  happening,"  said  Thorin.  "The  time  has  gone  for  the 
autumn  wanderings;  and  these  are  birds  that  dwell  always  in  the  land;  there  are 
starlings  and  flocks  of  finches;  and  far  off  there  are  many  carrion  birds  as  if  a 
battle were afoot!" 
Suddenly Bilbo pointed: "There  is  that old  thrush again!" he cried. "He seems 
to have escaped, when Smaug  smashed  the mountain-side, but I don't suppose the 
snails have!" 
Sure  enough  the  old  thrush was  there,  and  as  Bilbo  pointed,  he  flew  towards 
them  and  perched  on  a  stone  near  by. Then  he  fluttered  his wings  and  sang;  then 
he  cocked  his  head  on  one  side,  as  if  to  listen;  and  again  he  sang,  and  again  he 
listened. 
"I  believe  he  is  trying  to  tell  us  something,"  said  Balin;  "but  I  cannot  follow 
the  speech  of  such  birds,  it  is  very  quick  and  difficult.  Can  you  make  it  out 
Baggins?" 
"Not very well," said Bilbo (as a matter of fact, he could make nothing of it at 
all); "but the old fellow seems .very excited." 
"I only wish he was a raven!" said Balin. 
"I  thought  you  did  not  like  them!  You  seemed  very  shy  of  them,  when  we 
came this way before." 
"Those  were  crows!  And  nasty  suspicious-looking  creatures  at  that,  and  rude 
as  well.  You  must  have  heard  the  ugly  names  they were  calling  after  us. But  the 
ravens  are  different.  There  used  to  be  great  friendship  between  them  and  the 
people  of  Thror;  and  they  often  brought  us  secret  news,  and were  rewarded with 
such bright things as they coveted to hide in their dwellings. 
"They  live many  a  year,  and  their memories  are  long,  and  they  hand  on  their 
wisdom to their children. I knew many among the ravens of the rocks when I was 
a  dwarf-  lad.  This  very  height  was  once  named  Ravenhill,  because  there  was  a 

####-wise  and  famous  pair,  old  Care  and  his  wife,  that  lived  here  above  the  guard-
chamber. But I don't suppose that any of that ancient breed linger here now." 
No  sooner  had  he  finished  speaking  than  the  old  thrush  gave  a  loud  call,  and 
immediately flew away.  
"We may not understand him, but that old bird understands us, I am sure," said 
Balin. "Keep watch now, and see what happens!" 
Before  long  there  was  a  fluttering  of  wings,  and  back  came  the  thrush;  and 
with him came a most decrepit old bird. He was getting blind, he could hardly fly, 
and  the  top of his head was bald. He was an aged raven of great size. He alighted 
stiffly  on  the  ground  before  them,  slowly  flapped  his wings,  and  bobbed  towards 
Thorin. 
"O  Thorin  son  of  Thrain,  and  Balin  son  of  Fundin,"  he  croaked  (and  Bilbo 
could  understand  what  he  said,  for  he  used  ordinary  language  and  not  bird-
speech).  "I  am  Róac  son  of  Carc.  Carc  is  dead,  but  he  was  well  known  to  you 
once. It is a hundred years and three and fifty since I came out of the egg, but I do 
not  forget what my  father  told me. Now  I  am  the  chief  of  the  great  ravens  of  the 
Mountain. We are few, but we remember still the king that was of old. Most of my 
people are abroad, for there are great tidings in the South – some are tidings of joy 
to you, and some you will not think so good. 
"Behold! the birds are gathering back again to the Mountain and to Dale from 
South and East and West, for word has gone out that Smaug is dead!" 
"Dead!  Dead?"  shouted  the  dwarves.  "Dead!  Then  we  have  been  in  needless 
fear-and the treasure is ours!" 
They all sprang up and began to caper about for joy.  
"Yes,  dead,"  said Róac. "The  thrush, may his feathers never fall, saw him die, 
and  we may  trust  his  words.  He  saw  him  fall  in  battle  with  the men  of  Esgaroth 
the third night back from now at the rising of the moon." 
It was some time before Thorin could bring the dwarves to be silent and listen 
to  the  raven's  news. At  length when  he  had  told  all  the  tale  of  the  battle  he went 
on: 
"So  much  for  joy,  Thorin  Oakenshield.  You  may  go  back  to  your  halls  in 
safety;  all  the  treasure  is  yours-for  the  moment.  But  many  are  gathering  hither 
beside  the  birds.  The  news  of  the  death  of  the  guardian  has  already  gone  far  and 
wide, and the legend of the wealth of Thror has not lost in the telling during many 
years; many are eager for a share of the spoil. Already a host of the elves is on the 
way,  and  carrion birds  are with  them hoping  for battle  and  slaughter. By  the  lake 
men murmur  that  their sorrows are due  to  the dwarves; for  they are homeless and 

####-many  have  died,  and  Smaug  has  destroyed  their  town.  They  too  think  to  find 
amends from your treasure, whether you are alive or dead. 
"Your  own wisdom must  decide  your  course,  but  thirteen  is  small  remnant  of 
the great folk of Durin that once dwelt here, and now are scattered far. If you will 
listen to my counsel, you will not trust the Master of the Lake-men, but rather him 
that  shot  the  dragon  with  his  bow.  Bard  is  he,  of  the  race  of  Dale,  of  the  line  of 
Girion; he is a grim man but true. We would see peace once more among dwarves 
and  men  and  elves  after  the  long  desolation;  but  it  may  cost  you  dear  in  gold.  I 
have spoken." 
Then Thorin burst forth in anger: "Our thanks, Róac Carc's son. You and your 
people shall not be forgotten. But none of our gold shall thieves take or the violent 
carry  off  while  we  are  alive.  If  you  would  earn  our  thanks  still  more,  bring  us 
news of any that draw near. Also I would beg of you, if any of you are still young 
and strong of wing, that you would send messengers to our kin in the mountains of 
the  North,  both  west  from  here  and  east,  and  tell  them  of  our  plight.  But  go 
specially to my cousin Dain in the Iron Hills, for he has many people well-armed, 
and dwells nearest to this place. Bid him hasten!" 
"I  will  not  say  if  this  counsel  be  good  or  bad,"  croaked  Róac;  "but  I will  do 
what can be done." Then off he slowly flew.  
"Back now to the Mountain!" cried Thorin. "We have little time to lose." 
"And  little  food  to  use!"  cried  Bilbo,  always  practical  on  such  points.  In  any 
case  he  felt  that  the  adventure was, properly speaking, over  .with  the death of  the 
dragon-in  which  he  was  much  mistaken-and  he  would  have  given  most  of  his 
share of the profits for the peaceful winding up of these affairs. 
"Back  to  the  Mountain!"  cried  the  dwarves  as  if  they  had  not  heard  him;  so 
back he had  to go with  them. As you have heard  some of  the  events  already, you 
will  see  that  the  dwarves  still  had  some  days  before  them.  They  explored  the 
caverns  once  more,  and  found,  as  they  expected,  that  only  the  Front  Gate 
remained  open;  all  the  other  gates  (except,  of  course,  the  small  secret  door)  had 
long  ago  been  broken  and  blocked  by  Smaug,  and  no  sign  of  them  remained.  So 
now  they  began  to  labour  hard  in  fortifying  the  main  entrance,  and  in  remaking 
the  road  that  led  from  it.  Tools  were  to  be  found  in  plenty  that  the  miners  and 
quarriers  and  builders  of  old  had  used;  and  at  such  work  the  dwarves  were  still 
very skilled. 
As  they  worked  the  ravens  brought  them  constant  tidings.  In  this  way  they 
learned  that  the  Elvenking  had  turned  aside  to  the  Lake,  and  they  still  had  a 
breathing  space. Better  still,  they heard  that  three of  their ponies had escaped and 

####-were wandering wild far down the banks of the Running River, not far from where 
the  rest of  their  stores had been  left. So while  the others went on with  their work, 
Fili  and  Kili  were  sent,  guided  by  a  raven,  to  find  the  ponies  and  bring  back  all 
they could. 
They were  four  days  gone,  and  by  that  time  they  knew  that  the  joined  armies 
of  the  Lake-men  and  the  Elves  were  hurrying  towards  the  Mountain.  But  now 
their hopes were higher; for they had food for some weeks with care-chiefly cram, 
of course, and they were very tired of it; but cram is much better than nothing-and 
already the gate was blocked with a wall of squared stones laid dry, but very thick 
and  high  across  the  opening.  There  were  holes  in  the  wall  through  which  they 
could  see  (or  shoot)  but  no  entrance.  They  climbed  in  or  out  with  ladders,  and 
hauled stuff up with ropes. For the issuing of the stream they had contrived a small 
low arch under the new wall; but near the entrance they had so altered the narrow 
bed  that  a wide pool  stretched  from  the mountain-wall to the head of the fall over 
which  the  stream  went  towards  Dale.  Approach  to  the  Gate  was  now  only 
possible, without  swimming,  along  a narrow  ledge of  the  cliff,  to  the  right  as one 
looked  outwards  from  the wall.  The  ponies  they  had  brought  only  to  the  head  of 
the  steps  above  the  old  bridge,  and  unloading  them  there  had  bidden  them  return 
to their masters and sent them back riderless to the South. 
There  came  a  night  when  suddenly  there  were  many  lights  as  of  fires  and 
torches away south in Dale before them. 
"They  have  come!"  called  Balin.  "And  their  camp  is  very  great.  They  must 
have come into the valley under the cover of dusk along both banks of the river." 
That night the dwarves slept little. The morning was still pale when they saw a 
company approaching. From behind  their wall  they watched  them come up  to  the 
valley's head and climb slowly up. Before long they could see that both men of the 
lake  armed  as  if  for  war  and  elvish  bowmen  were  among  them.  At  length  the 
foremost  of  these  climbed  the  tumbled  rocks  and  appeared  at  the  top  of  the  falls; 
and very great was their surprise to see the pool before them and the Gate blocked 
with a wall of new-hewn stone. 
As they stood pointing and speaking to one another Thorin hailed them: "Who 
are  you,"  he  called  in  a  very  loud  voice,  "that  come  as  if  in  war  to  the  gates  of 
Thorin son of Thrain, King under the Mountain, and what do you desire?" 
But  they  answered  nothing.  Some  turned  swiftly  back,  and  the  others  after 
gazing  for  a while  at  the Gate  and  its  defences  soon  followed  them. That  day  the 
camp was moved  and was  brought  right  between  the  arms  of  the Mountain.  The 
rocks echoed then with voices and with song, as they had not done for many a day. 

####-There was  the  sound,  too,  of  elven-harps and of sweet music; and as  it echoed up 
towards  them  it  seemed  that  the  chill  of  the  air  was  warmed,  and  they  caught 
faintly the fragrance of woodland flowers blossoming in spring. 
Then Bilbo longed to escape from the dark fortress and to go down and join in 
the mirth  and  feasting  by  the  fires.  Some  of  the  younger  dwarves were moved  in 
their  hearts,  too,  and  they  muttered  that  they  wished  things  had  fallen  out 
otherwise and that they might welcome such folk as friends; but Thorin scowled. 
Then  the  dwarves  themselves  brought  forth  harps  and  instruments  regained 
from  the  hoard,  and  made  music  to  soften  his  mood;  but  their  song  was  not  as 
elvish song, and was much like the song they had sung long before in Bilbo's little 
hobbit-hole. 
 

Under the Mountain dark and tall 
The King has come unto his hall! 
His foe is dead, the Worm of Dread, 
And ever so his foes shall fall. 
 
The sword is sharp, the spear is long, 
The arrow swift, the Gate is strong; 
The heart is bold that looks on gold; 
The dwarves no more shall suffer wrong. 
 
The dwarves of yore made mighty spells, 
While hammers fell like ringing bells 
In places deep, where dark things sleep, 
In hollow halls beneath the fells. 
 
On silver necklaces they strung 
The light of stars, on crowns they hung 
The dragon-fire, from twisted wire  
The melody of harps they wrung. 
 
The mountain throne once more is freed! 
O! wandering folk, the summons heed! 
Come haste! Come haste! across the waste! 
The king of friend and kin has need. 
 
Now call we over mountains cold, 
'Come hack unto the caverns old'! 
Here at the Gates the king awaits, 

####-His hands are rich with gems and gold. 
 
The king is come unto his hall 
Under the Mountain dark and tall. 
The Worm of Dread is slain and dead, 
And ever so our foes shall fall! 

 
This song appeared to please Thorin, and he smiled again and grew merry; and 
he began reckoning the distance to the Iron Hills and how long it would be before 
Dain  could  reach  the  Lonely Mountain,  if  he  had  set  out  as  soon  as  the message 
reached  him.  But  Bilbo's  heart  fell,  both  at  the  song  and  the  talk:  they  sounded 
much  too  warlike.  The  next  morning  early  a  company  of  spearmen  was  seen 
crossing  the  river,  and  marching  up  the  valley.  They  bore  with  them  the  green 
banner of the Elvenking and the blue banner of the Lake, and they advanced until 
they stood right before the wall at the Gate. 
Again Thorin hailed  them  in a  loud voice: "Who are you  that come armed for 
war to the gates of Thorin son of Thrain, King under the Mountain?" This time he 
was answered. 
A  tall  man  stood  forward,  dark  of  hair  and  grim  of  face,  and  he  cried:  "Hail 
Thorin! Why do you fence yourself like a robber in his hold? We are not yet foes, 
and  we  rejoice  that  you  are  alive  beyond  our  hope.  We  came  expecting  to  find 
none  living  here;  yet  now  that  we  are  met  there  is  matter  for  a  parley  and  a 
council." 
"Who are you, and of what would you parley?" 
"I am Bard, and by my hand was the dragon slain and your treasure delivered. 
Is that not a matter that concerns you? Moreover I am by right descent the heir of 
Girion of Dale,  and  in your hoard  is mingled much of  the wealth of his halls  and 
town,  which  of  old  Smaug  stole.  Is  not  that  a  matter  of  which  we  may  speak? 
Further  in  his  last  battle  Smaug  destroyed  the  dwellings  of  the men  of  Esgaroth, 
and  I  am  yet  the  servant  of  their Master.  I would  speak  for  him  and  ask whether 
you  have  no  thought  for  the  sorrow  and misery  of  his  people.  They  aided  you  in 
your  distress,  and  in  recompense  you  have  thus  far  brought  ruin  only,  though 
doubtless undesigned." 
Now  these were  fair words and  true,  if proudly and grimly  spoken; and Bilbo 
thought  that Thorin would at once admit what  justice was  in  them. He did not, of 
course,  expect  that  any one would remember that it was he who discovered all by 
himself the dragon's weak spot; and that was just as well, for no one ever did. But 
also he did not reckon with the power that gold has upon which a dragon has long 

####-brooded,  nor with  dwarvish  hearts. Long hours  in  the past days Thorin had  spent 
in the treasury, and the lust of it was heavy on him. Though he had hunted chiefly 
for  the Arkenstone, yet he had  an  eye  for many  another wonderful  thing  that was 
lying there, about which were wound old memories of the labours and the sorrows 
of his race. 
"You  put  your worst  cause  last  and  in  the  chief  place," Thorin  answered.  "To 
the treasure of my people no man has a claim, because Smaug who stole it from us 
also  robbed  him  of  life  or  home.  The  treasure  was  not  his  that  his  evil  deeds 
should  be  amended  with  a  share  of  it.  The  price  of  the  goods  and  the  assistance 
that we  received of  the Lake-men we will fairly pay-in due time. But nothing will 
we  give,  not  even  a  loaf's  worth,  under  threat  of  force. While  an  armed host  lies 
before our doors, we look on you as foes and thieves. 
"It is in my mind to ask what share of their inheritance you would have paid to 
our kindred, had you found the hoard unguarded and us slain." 
"A just question," replied Bard. "But you are not dead, and we are not robbers. 
Moreover  the  wealthy  may  have  pity  beyond  right  on  the  needy  that  befriended 
them when they were in want. And still my other claims remain unanswered." 
"I will  not  parley,  as  I  have  said, with  armed men  at my  gate. Nor  at all with 
the people of the Elvenking, whom I remember with small kindness. In this debate 
they have no place. Begone now ere our arrows fly! And if you would speak with 
me  again,  first  dismiss  the  elvish  host  to  the  woods  where  it  belongs,  and  then 
return, laying down your arms before you approach the threshold." 
"The Elvenking  is my  friend,  and  he  has  succoured  the  people  of  the Lake  in 
their need, though they had no claim but friendship on him," answered Bard. "We 
will  give  you  time  to  repent  your  words.  Gather  your  wisdom  ere  we  return!" 
Then he departed and went back to the camp. 
Ere  many  hours  were  past,  the  banner-bearers  returned,  and  trumpeters  stood 
forth and blew a blast: 
"In  the  name  of  Esgaroth  and  the  Forest,"  one  cried,  "we  speak  unto  Thorin 
Thrain's  son  Oakenshield,  calling  himself  the  King  under  the  Mountain,  and  we 
bid him consider well  the claims  that have been urged, or be declared our  foe. At 
the  least  he  shall  deliver  one  twelfth  portion  of  the  treasure  unto  Bard,  as  the 
dragon-slayer,  and  as  the  heir  of  Girion.  From  that  portion  Bard  will  himself 
contribute  to  the  aid  of  Esgaroth;  but  if  Thorin  would  have  the  friendship  and 
honour of the lands about, as his sires had of old, then he will give also somewhat 
of his own  for  the comfort of  the men of  the Lake." Then Thorin seized a bow of 

####-horn  and  shot  an  arrow  at  the  speaker.  It  smote  into  his  shield  and  stuck  there 
quivering. 
'"Since  such  is  your  answer,"  he  called  in  return,  "I  declare  the  Mountain 
besieged. You shall not depart from it, until you call on your side for a truce and a 
parley. We will bear no weapons against you, but we leave you to your gold. You 
may eat that, if you will!" 
With  that  the  messengers  departed  swiftly,  and  the  dwarves  were  left  to 
consider  their  case. So grim had Thorin become, that even if they had wished, the 
others  would  not  have  dared  to  find  fault  with  him;  but  indeed  most  of  them 
seemed  to  share  his mind-except perhaps old fat Bombur and Fili and Kili. Bilbo, 
of course, disapproved of  the whole  turn of affairs. He had by now had more than 
enough of the Mountain, and being besieged inside it was not at all to his taste. 
"The whole place still stinks of dragon," he grumbled to himself, "and it makes 
me sick. And cram is beginning simply to stick in my throat."

A Thief in the Night 

 
Now the days passed slowly and wearily. Many of the dwarves spent their time 
piling  and  ordering  the  treasure;  and  now  Thorin  spoke  of  the  Arkenstone  of 
Thrain, and bade them eagerly to look for it in every comer.  
"For the Arkenstone of my father," he said, "is worth more than a river of gold 
in  itself,  and  to me  it  is  beyond  price.  That  stone  of  all  the  treasure  I  name  unto 
myself, and I will be avenged on anyone who finds it and withholds it." 
Bilbo heard these words and he grew afraid, wondering what would happen, if 
the stone was found-wrapped in an old bundle of tattered oddments that he used as 
a pillow. All the same he did not speak of it, for as the weariness of the days grew 
heavier, the beginnings of a plan had come into his little head. 
Things had gone on like this for some time, when the ravens brought news that 
Dain and more than five hundred dwarves, hurrying from the Iron Hills, were now 
within about two days' march of Dale, coming from the North-East. 
"But  they  cannot  reach  the  Mountain  unmarked,"  said  Róac,  "and  I  fear  lest 
there  be  battle  in  the  valley.  I  do  not  call  this  counsel  good.  Though  they  are  a 
grim  folk,  they  are  not  likely  to  overcome  the  host  that  besets  you;  and  even  if 
they  did  so, what will  you gain? Winter and snow is hastening behind them. How 
shall you be  fed without  the  friendship and goodwill of  the  lands about you? The 
treasure is likely to be your death, though the dragon is no more!"' 
But  Thorin  was  not moved.  "Winter  and  snow  will  bite both men and elves," 
he said, "and they may find their dwelling in the Waste grievous to bear. With my 
friends behind  them and winter upon  them,  they will perhaps be  in softer mood  to 
parley with." 
That night Bilbo made up his mind. The sky was black and moonless. As soon 
as  it  was  full  dark,  he  went  to  a  corner  of  an  inner  chamber  just  within  the  gate 
and drew from his bundle a rope, and also the Arkenstone wrapped in a rag. Then 
he  climbed  to  the  top  of  the  wall.  Only  Bombur  was  there,  for  it  was  his  turn to 
watch, and the dwarves kept only one watchman at a time. 
"It is mighty cold!" said Bombur. "I wish we could have a fire up here as they 
have in the camp!" 
"It is warm enough inside," said Bilbo. 

####-"I  daresay;  but  I  am  bound  here  till  midnight,"  grumbled  the  fat  dwarf.  "A 
sorry  business  altogether.  Not  that  I  venture  to  disagree  with  Thorin,  may  his 
beard grow ever longer; yet he was ever a dwarf with a stiff neck." 
"Not as stiff as my legs," said Bilbo. "I am tired of stairs and stone passages. I 
would give a good deal for the feel of grass at my toes." 
"I would give a good deal for the feel of a strong drink in my throat, and for a 
soft bed after a good supper!" 
"I  can't  give  you  those,  while  the  siege  is  going  on.  But  it  is  long  since  I 
watched,  and  I  will  take  your  turn  for  you,  if  you  like.  There  is  no  sleep  in  me 
tonight." 
  "You  are  a  good  fellow,  Mr.  Baggins,  and  I  will  take  your  offer  kindly.  If 
there  should  be  anything  to  note,  rouse me  first, mind  you!  I will  lie  in  the  inner 
chamber to the left, not far away." 
"Off you go!" said Bilbo. "I will wake you at midnight, and you can wake the 
next watchman." As soon as Bombur had gone, Bilbo put on his ring, fastened his 
rope,  slipped  down  over  the wall,  and was  gone. He  had  about  five  hours  before 
him.  Bombur  would  sleep  (he  could  sleep  at  any  time,  and  ever  since  the 
adventure  in  the  forest he was  always  trying  to  recapture  the beautiful dreams he 
had then); and all the others were busy with Thorin. It was unlikely that any, even 
Fili  or  Kili,  would  come out on  the wall until  it was  their  turn.  It was very dark, 
and  the  road  after  a  while,  when  he  left  the  newly made  path  and  climbed  down 
towards the lower course of the stream, was strange to him. At last he came to the 
bend  where  he  had  to  cross  the  water,  if  he  was  to  make  for  the  camp,  as  he 
wished. The bed of the stream was there shallow but already broad, and fording it 
in the dark was not easy for the little hobbit. He was nearly across when he missed 
his  footing  on  a  round  stone  and  fell  into  the  cold  water  with  a  splash.  He  had 
barely  scrambled  out  on  the  far  bank,  shivering  and  spluttering,  when  up  came 
elves in the gloom with bright lanterns and searched for the cause of the noise. 
"That  was  no  fish!"  one  said.  "There  is  a  spy  about.  Hide  your  lights! They 
will help him more  than us,  if  it  is  that queer  little creature  that  is said  to be  their 
servant." 
"Servant,  indeed!"  snorted  Bilbo;  and  in  the  middle  of  his  snort  he  sneezed 
loudly, and the elves immediately gathered towards the sound. 
"Let's  have  a  light!"  he  said.  "I  am  here,  if  you want me!"  and  he  slipped  off 
his ring, and popped from behind a rock. 

####-They seized him quickly, in spite of their surprise. "Who are you? Are you the 
dwarves' hobbit? What are you doing? How did you get so far past our sentinels?" 
they asked one after another.  
"I am Mr. Bilbo Baggins," he answered, "companion of Thorin, if you want to 
know. I know your king well by sight, though perhaps he doesn't know me to look 
at. But Bard will remember me, and it is Bard I particularly want to see." 
"Indeed!" said they, "and what may be your business?"  
"Whatever  it  is,  it's my own, my good  elves. But  if you wish  ever  to get back 
to  your  own  woods  from  this  cold  cheerless  place,"  he  answered  shivering,  "you 
will  take me  along  quiet  to a fire, where I can dry-and then you will let me speak 
to your chiefs as quick as may be. I have only an hour or two to spare." 
That is how it came about that some two hours after his escape from the Gate, 
Bilbo  was  sitting  beside  a  warm  fire  in  front  of  a  large  tent,  and  there  sat  too, 
gazing curiously at him, both the Elvenking and Bard. A hobbit in elvish armour, 
partly wrapped in an old blanket, was something new to them. 
"Really you know," Bilbo was  saying  in his best business manner,  "things  are 
impossible. Personally I am tired of the whole affair. I wish I was back in the West 
in  my  own  home,  where  folk  are  more  reasonable.  But  I  have  an  interest  in  this 
matter-one  fourteenth share,  to be precise, according  to a  letter, which  fortunately 
I believe I have kept." He drew from a pocket in his old jacket (which he still wore 
over his mail), crumpled and much folded, Thorin's letter that had been put under 
the clock on his mantelpiece in May! 
"A share in the profits, mind you," he went on. "I am aware of that. Personally 
I am only too ready to consider all your claims carefully, and deduct what is right 
from  the  total  before  putting  in my  own  claim.  However  you  don't  know  Thorin 
Oakenshield as well as I do now. I assure you, he is quite ready to sit on a heap of 
gold and starve, as long as you sit here." 
"Well, let him!" said Bard. "Such a fool deserves to starve." 
"Quite  so,"  said  Bilbo.  "I  see  your  point  of  view.  At  the  same  time  winter  is 
coming  on  fast. Before  long  you will  be  having  snow  and what not, and supplies 
will  be  difficult  –  even  for  elves  I  imagine.  Also  there  will  be  other  difficulties. 
You have not heard of Dain and the dwarves of the Iron Hills?" 
"We have, a long time ago; but what has he got to do with us?" asked the king. 
"I  thought  as much.  I  see  I  have  some  information  you  have  not  got.  Dain,  I 
may  tell  you,  is  now  less  than  two  days' march  off,  and  has  at  least  five  hundred 
grim  dwarves  with  him  –  a  good  many  of  them  have  had  experience  in  the 

####-dreadful  dwarf  and  goblin  wars,  of  which  you  have  no  doubt  heard. When  they 
arrive there may be serious trouble." 
"Why  do  you  tell  us  this?  Are  you  betraying  your  friends,  or  are  you 
threatening us?" asked Bard grimly.  
"My  dear  Bard!"  squeaked  Bilbo.  "Don't  be  so  hasty!  I  never  met  such 
suspicious folk! I am merely trying to avoid trouble for all concerned. Now I will 
make you an offer!!" 
"Let us hear it!" they said. 
"You may  see  it!"  said  he.  "It  is  this!"  and  he  drew  forth  the Arkenstone,  and 
threw away the wrapping. 
The Elvenking himself, whose eyes were used to things of wonder and beauty, 
stood up in amazement. Even Bard gazed marvelling at it in silence. It was as if a 
globe had been  filled with moonlight and hung before  them  in a net woven of  the 
glint of frosty stars. 
"This  is  the  Arkenstone  of  Thrain,"  said  Bilbo,  "the  Heart  of  the  Mountain; 
and  it  is  also  the  heart  of  Thorin.  He  values  it  above  a  river  of  gold.  I  give  it  to 
you.  It  will  aid  you  in  your  bargaining."  Then  Bilbo,  not  without  a  shudder,  not 
without a glance of longing, handed the marvellous stone to Bard, and he held it in 
his hand, as though dazed. 
"But how is it yours to give?" he asked at last with an effort. 
"O  well!"  said  the  hobbit  uncomfortably.  "It  isn't  exactly;  but,  well,  I  am 
willing  to  let  it  stand  against  all my claim, don't you know. I may be a burglar-or 
so  they  say: personally  I never  really  felt  like one-but I am an honest one, I hope, 
more  or  less.  Anyway  I  am  going  back  now,  and  the  dwarves  can  do  what  they 
like to me. I hope you will find it useful." 
The Elvenking looked at Bilbo with a new wonder.  
"Bilbo  Baggins!"  he  said.  "You  are  more  worthy  to  wear  the  armour  of  elf-
princes  than  many  that  have  looked  more  comely  in  it.  But  I  wonder  if  Thorin 
Oakenshield will see it so. I have more knowledge of dwarves  in general than you 
have perhaps. I advise you to remain with us, and here you shall be honoured and 
thrice welcome." 
"Thank you very much I am sure," said Bilbo with a bow. "But I don't think I 
ought to leave my friends like this, after all we have gone through together. And I 
promised  to  wake  old  Bombur  at  midnight,  too!  Really  I  must  be  going,  and 
quickly." 
Nothing  they  could  say  would  stop  him;  so  an  escort  was  provided  for  him, 
and  as  he  went  both  the  king  and  Bard  saluted  him  with  honour.  As  they  passed 

####-through  the  camp  an  old  man  wrapped  in  a  dark  cloak,  rose  from  a  tent  door 
where he was sitting and came towards them. 
"Well  done!  Mr.  Baggins!"  he  said,  clapping  Bilbo  on  the  back.  "There  is 
always more about you than anyone expects!" It was Gandalf. 
For the first time for many a day Bilbo was really delighted. But there was no 
time for all the questions that he immediately wished to ask. 
"All  in  good  time!"  said  Gandalf.  "Things  are  drawing  towards  the  end  now, 
unless  I  am  mistaken.  There  is  an  unpleasant  time  just  in  front  of  you;  but  keep 
your heart up! You may  come  through  all  right. There  is news brewing  that  even 
the ravens have not heard. Good night!" 
Puzzled  but  cheered.  Bilbo  hurried  on.  He  was  guided  to  a  safe  ford  and  set 
across  dry,  and  then  he  said  farewell  to  the  elves  and  climbed  carefully  back 
towards the Gate. Great weariness began to come over him; but it was well before 
midnight when he  clambered up  the  rope  again  –  it was  still where he had  left  it. 
He untied  it and hid  it, and  then he sat down on the wall and wondered anxiously 
what would happen next. 
At  midnight  he  woke  up  Bombur;  and  then  in  turn  rolled  himself  up  in  his 
corner,  without  listening  to  old  dwarfs  thanks  (which  he  felt  he  had  hardly 
earned).  He  was  soon  fast  asleep  forgetting  all  his  worries  till  the  morning.  As 
matter of fact he was dreaming of eggs and bacon. 

####-<h4>Chapter 17</h4> <br> 

The Clouds Burst 

 
Next  day  the  trumpets  rang  early  in  the  camp. Soon  a  single  runner was  seen 
hurrying  along  the  narrow  path.  At  a  distance  he  stood  and  hailed  them,  asking 
whether Thorin would now listen to another embassy, since new tidings had come 
to hand, and matters were changed. 
"That will be Dain!" said Thorin when he heard. "They will have got wind of 
his  coming.  I  thought  that would  alter  their mood! Bid them come few in number 
and weaponless, and I will hear," he called to the messenger.  
About  midday  the  banners  of  the  Forest  and  the  Lake  were  seen  to  be  borne 
forth  again.  A  company  of  twenty  was  approaching.  At  the  beginning  of  the 
narrow  way  they  laid  aside  sword  and  spear,  and  came  on  towards  the  Gate. 
Wondering, the dwarves saw that among them were both Bard and the Elvenking, 
before whom an old man wrapped in cloak and hood bore a strong casket of iron-
bound wood. 
"Hail Thorin!" said Bard. "Are you still of the same mind?" 
"My mind does not change with the rising and setting of a few suns," answered 
Thorin. "Did you come to ask me idle questions? Still the elf-host has not departed 
as  I  bade! Till  then  you  come  in  vain  to  bargain with me."  "Is  there  then nothing 
for which you would yield any of your gold?" 
"Nothing that you or your friends have to offer." 
"What of the Arkenstone of Thrain?" said he, and at the same moment the old 
man  opened  the  casket  and  held  aloft  the  jewel.  The  light  leapt  from  his  hand, 
bright and white in the morning. 
Then Thorin was stricken dumb with amazement and confusion. No one spoke 
for  a  long while. Thorin  at  length broke  the  silence,  and his voice was  thick with 
wrath. "That stone was my father's, and is mine," he said. "Why should I purchase 
my  own?"  But  wonder  overcame  him  and  he  added:  "But  how  came  you  by  the 
heirloom of my house-if there is need to ask such a question of thieves?" 
"We  are  not  thieves," Bard  answered.  "Your  own we will  give  back  in  return 
for our own." 
'How came you by it?" shouted Thorin in gathering rage. 
"I gave it them!" squeaked Bilbo, who was peeping over the wall, by now, in a 
dreadful fright. 

####-"You!  You!"  cried  Thorin,  turning  upon  him  and  grasping  him  with  both 
hands.  "You  miserable  hobbit!  You  undersized-burglar!"  he  shouted  at  a  loss  for 
words, and he shook poor Bilbo like a rabbit. 
"By the beard of Durin! I wish I had Gandalf here! Curse him for his choice of 
you! May his beard wither! As for you I will throw you to the rocks!" he cried and 
lifted Bilbo in his arms. 
"Stay! Your wish is granted!" said a voice. The old man with the casket threw 
aside  his  hood  and  cloak.  "Here  is  Gandalf!  And  none  too  soon  it  seems.  If  you 
don't  like my Burglar, please don't damage him. Put him down,  and  listen first  to 
what he has to say!" 
"You  all  seem  in  league!"  said  Thorin  dropping  Bilbo  on  the  top  of  the wall. 
"Never  again will  I  have  dealings with  any wizard  or  his  friends. What  have  you 
to say, you descendant of rats?" 
"Dear  me!  Dear  me!"  said  Bilbo.  "I  am  sure  this  is  all  very  uncomfortable. 
You may remember saying that I might choose my own fourteenth share? Perhaps 
I took it too literally –1 have been told that dwarves are sometimes politer in word 
than  in  deed.  The  time  was,  all  the  same,  when  you  seemed  to  think  that  I  had 
been of some service. Descendant of rats, indeed! Is this ail the service of you and 
your family that I was promised. Thorin? Take it that I have disposed of my share 
as I wished, and let it go at that!" 
"I will,"  said Thorin  grimly.  "And  I will  let  you  go  at  that-and may we never 
meet again!" Then he turned and spoke over the wall. "I am betrayed," he said. "It 
was rightly guessed that I could not forbear to redeem the Arkenstone, the treasure 
of my house. For it I will give one fourteenth share of the hoard in silver and gold, 
setting  aside  the  gems;  but  that  shall  be  accounted  the  promised  share  of  this 
traitor, and with that reward he shall depart, and you can divide it as you will. He 
will  get  little  enough,  I  doubt  not.  Take  him,  if  you  wish  him  to  live;  and  no 
friendship of mine goes with him. 
"Get down now to your friends!" he said to Bilbo, "or I will throw you down." 
"What about the gold and silver?" asked Bilbo. 
"That shall follow after, as can be arranged," said he. 
"Get down!" 
"Until then we keep the stone," cried Bard. 
"You are not making a very splendid figure as King under the Mountain," said 
Gandalf. "But things may change yet." 

####-"They may indeed," said Thorin. And already, so strong was the bewilderment 
of  the  treasure upon him, he was pondering whether by the help of Dain he might 
not recapture the Arkenstone and withhold the share of the reward. 
And  so  Bilbo  was  swung  down  from  the  wall,  and  departed  with  nothing  for 
all his trouble, except the armour which Thorin had given him already. More than 
one of the dwarves 'in their hearts felt shame and pity at his going. 
"Farewell!" he cried to them. "We may meet again as friends." 
"Be  off!"  called  Thorin.  "You  have  mail  upon  you,  which  was  made  by  my 
folk,  and  is  too  good  for  you.  It  cannot  be  pierced  .by  arrows;  but  if  you  do  not 
hasten, I will sting your miserable feet. So be swift!" 
"Not so hasty!" said Bard. "We will give you until tomorrow. At noon we will 
return,  and  see  if  you  have  brought  from  the  hoard  the  portion  that  is  to  be  set 
against  the  stone.  If  that  is  done  without  deceit,  then  we  will  depart,  and  the  elf-
host will go back to the Forest. In the meanwhile farewell!" 
With  that  they  went  back  to  the  camp;  but  Thorin  sent  messengers  by  Róac 
telling Dain of what had passed, and bidding him come with wary speed. 
That day passed and the night. The next day the wind shifted west, and the air 
was  dark  and  gloomy.  The  morning  was  still  early  when  a  cry  was  heard  in  the 
camp.  Runners  came  in  to  report  that  a  host  of  dwarves  had  appeared  round  the 
eastern spur of  the Mountain and was now hastening  to Dale. Dain had come. He 
had  hurried  on  through  the  night,  and  so  had  come  upon  them  sooner  than  they 
had expected. Each one of his folk was clad in a hauberk of steel mail that hung to 
his  knees,  and  his  legs were  covered with  hose  of  a  fine  and  flexible metal mesh, 
the secret of whose making was possessed by Dain's people. 
The  dwarves  are  exceedingly  strong  for  their  height,  but  most  of  these  were 
strong  even  for  dwarves.  In  battle  they  wielded  heavy  two-handed mattocks;  but 
each of  them had also a  short broad  sword at his  side and a  round  shield  slung at 
his  back.  Their  beards  were  forked  and  plaited  and  thrust  into  their  belts.  Their 
caps  were  of  iron  and  they  were  shod  with  iron,  and  their  faces  were  grim. 
Trumpets  called  men  and  elves  to  arms.  Before  long  the  dwarves  could  be  seen 
coming  up  the  valley  at  a  great  pace.  They  halted  between  the  river  and  the 
eastern  spur;  but  a  few  held  on  their  way,  and  crossing  the  river  drew  near  the 
camp;  and  there  they  laid  down  their weapons  and  held  up  their  hands  in  sign  of 
peace. Bard went out to meet them, and with him went Bilbo. 
"We  are  sent  from  Dain  son  of  Nain,"  they  said  when  questioned.  "We  are 
hastening  to our kinsmen  in  the Mountain, since we learn that the kingdom of old 
is  renewed. But who  are  you  that  sit  in  the  plain  as  foes  before  defended walls?" 

####-This, of. course, in the polite and rather old-fashioned language of such occasions, 
meant simply: "You have no business  here. We are going on, so make way or we 
shall fight you!" They meant to push on between the Mountain and the loop of the 
river, for the narrow land there did not seem to be strongly guarded. 
Bard,  of  course,  refused  to  allow  the  dwarves  to  go  straight  on  to  the 
Mountain. He was  determined  to wait  until  the  gold  and  silver  had  been  brought 
out in exchange for the Arkenstone: for he did not believe that this would be done, 
if  once  the  fortress  was manned  with  so  large  and  warlike  a  company.  They  had 
brought with  them a great store of supplies; for  the dwarves can carry very heavy 
burdens,  and  nearly  all  of  Dain's  folks,  in  spite  of  their  rapid  march,  bore  huge 
packs  on  their  backs  in  addition  to  their  weapons.  They  would  stand  a  siege  for 
weeks,  and  by  that  time yet more dwarves might  come,  and yet more,  for Thorin 
had many relatives. Also they would be able to reopen and guard some other gate, 
so that the besiegers would have to encircle the whole mountain; and for that they 
had not sufficient numbers. 
These  were,  in  fact,  precisely  their  plans  (for  the  raven-messengers  had  been 
busy between Thorin and Dain); but  for  the moment  the way was barred, so after 
angry  words  the  dwarf-messengers  retired  muttering  in  their  beards.  Bard  then 
sent messengers  at  once  to  the Gate; but  they  found no gold or payment. Arrows 
came forth as soon as they were within shot, and they hastened back in dismay. In 
the  camp  all  was  now  astir,  as  if  for  battle;  for  the  dwarves  of  Dain  were 
advancing along the eastern bank. 
"Fools!"  laughed  Bard,  "to  come  thus  beneath  the  Mountain's  arm!  They  do 
not understand war above ground, whatever they may know of battle in the mines. 
There  are many  of  our  archers  and  spearmen  now  hidden  in  the  rocks  upon  their 
right  flank. Dwarf-mail may  be  good,  but  they will  soon be hard put  to  it. Let us 
set on them now from both sides, before they are fully rested!" 
But  the  Elvenking  said:  "Long will  I  tarry,  ere  I  begin  this war  for  gold.  The 
dwarves cannot press us, unless we will, or do anything  that we cannot mark. Let 
us  hope  still  for  something  that  will  bring  reconciliation.  Our  advantage  in 
numbers will be enough, if in the end it must come to unhappy blows." 
But he reckoned without the dwarves. The knowledge that the Arkenstone was 
in  the  hands  of  the  besiegers  burned  in  their  thoughts;  also  they  guessed  the 
hesitation of Bard and his friends, and resolved to strike while they debated. 
Suddenly  without  a  signal  they  sprang  silently  forward  to  attack.  Bows 
twanged and arrows whistled; battle was about to be joined. 

####-Still  more  suddenly  a  darkness  came  on  with  dreadful  swiftness!  A  black 
cloud  hurried  over  the  sky. Winter  thunder  on  a wild wind  rolled  roaring  up  and 
rumbled  in  the  Mountain,  and  lightning  lit  its  peak.  And  beneath  the  thunder 
another  blackness  could  be  seen  whirling  forward;  but  it  did  not  come  with  the 
wind,  it  came  from  the  North,  like  a  vast  cloud  of  birds,  so  dense  that  no  light 
could be seen between their wings. 
"Halt!"  cried  Gandalf,  who  appeared  suddenly,  and  stood  alone,  with  arms 
uplifted, between  the advancing dwarves and  the  ranks awaiting  them. "Halt!" he 
called  in  a  voice  like  thunder,  and  his  staff  blazed  forth  with  a  flash  like  the 
lightning.  "Dread  has  come  upon  you  all!  Alas!  it  has  come  more  swiftly  than  I 
guessed. The Goblins  are upon you! Bolg*  of the North is coming. O Dain! whose 
father  you  slew  in  Moria.  Behold!  the  bats  are  above  his  army  like  a  sea  of 
locusts. They ride upon wolves and Wargs are in their train!" 
Amazement  and  confusion  fell  upon  them  all.  Even  as  Gandalf  had  been 
speaking  the  darkness  grew.  The  dwarves  halted  and  gazed  at  the  sky.  The  elves 
cried out with many voices. 
"Come!" called Gandalf.  "There  is yet  time  for council. Let Dain  son of Nain 
come swiftly to us!" 
 
So  began  a  battle  that  none  had  expected; and  it was called  the Battle of Five 
Armies,  and  it  was  very  terrible.  Upon  one  side  were  the  Goblins  and  the  wild 
Wolves, and upon  the other were Elves and Men and Dwarves. This  is how  it  fell 
out.  Ever  since  the  fall  of  the Great Goblin  of  the Misty Mountains  the hatred of 
their  race  for  the  dwarves  had  been  rekindled  to  fury. Messengers  had  passed  to 
and fro between all their cities, colonies and strongholds; for they resolved now to 
win  the  dominion  of  the  North.  Tidings  they  had  gathered  in  secret  ways; and  in 
all  the  mountains  there  was  a  forging  and  an  arming.  Then  they  marched  and 
gathered by hill  and valley, going  ever by  tunnel or under dark, until  around  and 
beneath the great mountain Gundabad of the North, where was their capital, a vast 
host  was  assembled  ready  to  sweep  down  in  time  of  storm  unawares  upon  the 
South. Then  they  learned of  the death of Smaug,  and  joy was  in  their hearts:  and 
they hastened night  after night  through  the mountains,  and  came  thus  at  last on  a 
sudden  from  the  North  hard  on  the  heels  of  Dain.  Not  even  the  ravens  knew  of 
their  coming  until  they  came  out  in  the  broken  lands  which  divided  the  Lonely 
Mountain from the hills behind. How much Gandalf knew cannot be said, but it is 
plain that he had not expected this sudden assault.

 Son of Azog 

####-This is the plan that he made in council with the Elvenking and with Bard; and 
with  Dain,  for  the  dwarf-lord  now  joined  them:  the  Goblins  were  the  foes  of  all, 
and at  their coming all other quarrels were  forgotten. Their only hope was  to  lure 
the  goblins  into  the  valley  between  the  arms  of  the Mountain;  and  themselves  to 
man  the  great  spurs  that  struck  south  and  east. Yet  this would  be  perilous,  if  the 
goblins  were  in  sufficient  numbers  to  overrun  the  Mountain  itself,  and  so  attack 
them also  from behind and above; but there was no time for make any other plan, 
or to summon any help. 
Soon  the  thunder  passed,  rolling  away  to  the  South-East;  but  the  bat-cloud 
came,  flying  lower,  over  the  shoulder  of  the  Mountain,  and  whirled  above  them 
shutting out the light and filling them with dread. 
"To  the  Mountain!"  called  Bard.  "To  the  Mountain!  Let  us  take  our  places 
while there is yet time!" 
On  the Southern spur,  in  its  lower slopes and  in  the  rocks at  its  feet,  the Elves 
were  set;  on  the  Eastern  spur  were men  and  dwarves.  But  Bard  and  some  of  the 
nimblest of men and elves climbed  to  the height of  the Eastern  shoulder  to gain a 
view  to  the North. Soon  they could see  the  lands before  the Mountain's  feet black 
with a hurrying multitude. Ere long the vanguard swirled round the spur's end and 
came  rushing  into  Dale.  These  were  the  swiftest  wolf-riders,  and  already  their 
cries  and  howls  rent  the  air  afar.  A  few  brave  men  were  strung  before  them  to 
make  a  feint  of  resistance,  and many  there  fell  before  the  rest  drew  back  and fled 
to  either  side.  As  Gandalf  had  hoped,  the  goblin  army  had  gathered  behind  the 
resisted  vanguard,  and  poured  now  in  rage  into  the  valley,  driving  wildly  up 
between  the  arms  of  the  Mountain,  seeking  for  the  foe.  Their  banners  were 
countless, black and red, and they came on like a tide in fury and disorder.  
It  was  a  terrible  battle.  The  most  dreadful  of  all  Bilbo's  experiences,  and  the 
one which  at  the  time he hated most  – which is to say it was the one he was most 
proud  of,  and  most  fond  of  recalling  long  afterwards,  although  he  was  quite 
unimportant in it. Actually I must say he put on his ring early in the business, and 
vanished  from  sight,  if  not  from  all  danger.  A  magic  ring  of  that  sort  is  not  a 
complete  protection  in  a  goblin  charge,  nor  does  it  stop  flying  arrows  and  wild 
spears;  but  it  does  help  in  getting  out  of  the way,  and  it  prevents  your  head  from 
being specially chosen for a sweeping stroke by a goblin swordsman. 
The  elves  were  the  first  to  charge.  Their  hatred  for  the  goblins  is  cold  and 
bitter. Their spears and swords shone  in  the gloom with a gleam of chill flame, so 
deadly  was  the  wrath  of  the  hands  that  held  them.  As  soon  as  the  host  of  their 
enemies was dense  in  the valley,  they sent against  it a shower of arrows, and each 

####-flickered  as  it  fled  as  if with  stinging  fire.  Behind  the  arrows  a  thousand  of  their 
spearmen  leapt  down  and  charged.  The  yells  were  deafening.  The  rocks  were 
stained  black  with  goblin  blood.  Just  as  the  goblins  were  recovering  from  the 
onslaught  and  the  elf-charge was halted,  there  rose  from across  the valley a deep-
throated  roar. With  cries  of  "Moria!"  and  "Dain,  Dain!"  the  dwarves  of  the  Iron 
Hills  plunged  in,  wielding  their  mattocks,  upon  the  other  side;  and  beside  them 
came  the  men  of  the  Lake  with  long  swords.  Panic  came  upon  the Goblins;  and 
even as they turned to meet this new attack, the elves charged again with renewed 
numbers. Already many of  the goblins were  flying back down  the  river  to  escape 
from the trap: and many of their own wolves were turning upon them and rending 
the  dead  and  the  wounded.  Victory  seemed  at  hand,  when  a  cry  rang  out  on  the 
heights above. 
Goblins  had  scaled  the Mountain  from  the  other  side  and  already many were 
on the slopes above the Gate, and others were streaming down recklessly, heedless 
of  those  that  fell  screaming  from  cliff  and  precipice,  to  attack  the  spurs  from 
above. Each of these could be reached by paths that ran down from the main mass 
of  the Mountain  in  the  centre;  and  the  defenders  had  too  few  to  bar  the  way  for 
long. Vi ctory now vanished from hope. They had only stemmed the first onslaught 
of the black tide. 
Day drew on. The goblins gathered again  in  the valley. There a host of Wargs 
came  ravening  and  with  them  came  the  bodyguard  of  Bolg,  goblins  of  huge  size 
with scimitars of steel. Soon actual darkness was coming into a stormy sky; while 
still  the great bats  swirled  about  the heads  and  ears of  elves  and men, or  fastened 
vampire-like  on  the  stricken.  Now  Bard  was  fighting  to  defend  the  Eastern  spur, 
and yet giving slowly back; and the elf-lords were at bay about their king upon the 
southern arm, near to the watch-post on Ravenhill. 
Suddenly  there  was  a  great  shout,  and  from  the  Gate  came  a  trumpet  call. 
They had forgotten Thorin! Part of  the wall, moved by  levers, fell outward with a 
crash  into  the  pool. Out  leapt  the King  under  the Mountain,  and  his  companions 
followed  him.  Hood  and  cloak  were  gone;  they  were  in  shining  armour,  and  red 
light  leapt  from  their  eyes.  In  the  gloom  the  great  dwarf  gleamed  like  gold  in  a 
dying fire. 
Rocks were buried down from on high by the goblins above; but they held on. 
leapt  down  to  the  falls'  foot,  and  rushed  forward  to  battle. Wolf  and  rider  fell  or 
fled before them. Thorin wielded his axe with mighty strokes, and nothing seemed 
to harm him. 

####-"To  me!  To  me!  Elves  and  Men!  To  me!  O  my  kinsfolk!"  he  cried,  and  his 
voice shook like a horn in the valley.  
Down, heedless of order, rushed all the dwarves of Dain to his help. Down too 
came  many  of  the  Lake-men,  for Bard  could  not  restrain  them;  and out upon  the 
other  side  came many  of  the  spearmen  of  the  elves. Once  again  the  goblins were 
stricken in the valley; and they were piled in heaps till Dale was dark and hideous 
with  their  corpses.  The  Wargs  were  scattered  and  Thorin  drove  right  against  the 
bodyguards  of  Bolg.  But  he  could  not  pierce  their  ranks.  Already  behind  him 
among the goblin dead lay many men and many dwarves, and many a fair elf that 
should  have  lived  yet  long  ages  merrily  in  the  wood.  And  as  the  valley  widened 
his onset grew ever slower. His numbers were too few. His flanks were unguarded. 
Soon  the  attackers  were  attacked,  and  they  were  forced  into  a  great  ring,  facing 
every  way,  hemmed  all  about  with  goblins  and  wolves  returning  to  the  assault. 
The bodyguard of Bolg came howling against them, and drove in upon their ranks 
like waves  upon  cliffs  of  sand.  Their  friends  could  not  help  them,  for  the  assault 
from  the Mountain was  renewed with  redoubled  force,  and  upon  either  side men 
and elves were being slowly beaten down. 
On  all  this  Bilbo  looked  with  misery.  He  had  taken  his  stand  on  Ravenhill 
among  the Elves-partly because  there was more chance of escape from  that point, 
and partly (with the more Tookish part of his mind) because if he was going to be 
in  a  last  desperate  stand,  he  preferred  on  the  whole  to  defend  the  Elvenking. 
Gandalf,  too,  I  may  say,  was  there,  sitting  on  the  ground  as  if  in  deep  thought, 
preparing,  I  suppose,  some  last  blast  of magic  before  the  end.  That  did  not  seem 
far off. "It will not be  long now,"  thought Bilbo, "before the goblins win the Gate, 
and  we  are  all  slaughtered  or  driven  down  and  captured.  Really  it  is  enough  to 
make  one  weep,  after  all  one  has  gone  through.  I  would  rather  old  Smaug  had 
been left with all the wretched treasure, than that these vile creatures should get it, 
and  poor  old Bombur,  and Balin  and  Fili  and Kili  and  all  the  rest  come  to  a  bad 
end;  and  Bard  too,  and  the  Lake-men  and  the  merry  elves.  Misery  me!  I  have 
heard  songs  of  many  battles,  and  I  have  always  understood  that  defeat  may  be 
glorious. It seems very uncomfortable, not to say distressing. I wish I was well out 
of it." 
The  clouds  were  torn  by  the  wind,  and  a  red  sunset  slashed  the West.  Seeing 
the  sudden  gleam  in  the  gloom  Bilbo  looked  round. He  gave  a  great  cry:  he  had 
seen  a  sight  that  made  his  heart  leap,  dark  shapes  small  yet  majestic  against  the 
distant glow.  
"The Eagles! The Eagles!" he shouted. "The Eagles are coming!" 

####-Bilbo's eyes were seldom wrong. The eagles were coming down the wind, line 
after line, in such a host as must have gathered from all the eyries of the North. 
"The  Eagles!  the  Eagles!"  Bilbo  cried,  dancing  and  waving  his  arms.  If  the 
elves could not see him they could hear him. Soon they too took up the cry, and it 
echoed  across  the  valley. Many wondering  eyes  looked up,  though as yet nothing 
could be seen except from the southern shoulders of the Mountain. 
"The Eagles!" cried Bilbo once more, but at that moment a stone hurtling from 
above smote heavily on his helm, and he fell with a crash and knew no more. 

####-<h4>Chapter 18</h4> <br> 

The Return Journey 

 
When Bilbo came  to himself, he was  literally by himself. He was  lying on  the 
flat stones of Ravenhill, and no one was near. A cloudless day, but cold, was broad 
above him. He was shaking, and as chilled as stone, but his head burned with fire. 
"Now I wonder what has happened?" he said to himself. "At any rate I am not 
yet one of the fallen heroes; but I suppose there is still time enough for that!" 
He  sat  up  painfully.  Looking  into  the  valley  he  could  see  no  living  goblins. 
After  a while as his head cleared a  little, he  thought he could see elves moving  in 
the  rocks  below.  He  rubbed  his  eyes.  Surely  there  was  a  camp  still  in  the  plain 
some  distance  off;  and  there  was  a  coming  and  going  about  the  Gate?  Dwarves 
seemed  to  be  busy  removing  the wall. But  all was deadly  still. There was no  call 
and  no  echo  of  a  song.  Sorrow  seemed  to  be  in  the  air.  "Victory  after  all,  I 
suppose!"  he  said,  feeling  his  aching  head.  "Well,  it  seems  a  very  gloomy 
business." 
Suddenly he was aware of a man climbing up and coming towards him. 
"Hullo there!" he called with a shaky voice. "Hullo there! What news?" 
"What  voice  is  it  that  speaks  among  the  stones?"  said  the  man  halting  and 
peering about him not far from where Bilbo sat. 
Then Bilbo remembered his ring! "Well I'm blessed!" said he. "This invisibility 
has  its  drawbacks  after  all.  Otherwise  I  suppose  I  might  have  spent  a  warm  and 
comfortable night in bed!" 
"It's me, Bilbo Baggins,  companion  of Thorin!"  he  cried,  hurriedly  taking  off 
the ring. 
"It  is  well  that  I  have  found  you!"  said  the  man  striding  forward.  "You  are 
needed and we have looked for you long. You would have been numbered among 
the  dead,  who  are many,  if  Gandalf  the  wizard  had  not  said  that  your  voice  was 
last  heard  in  this  place.  I  have  been  sent  to  look  here  for  the  last  time.  Are  you 
much hurt?" 
"A  nasty  knock  on  the  head,  I  think,"  said  Bilbo.  "But  I  have  a  helm  and  a 
hard skull. All the same I feel sick and my legs are like straws." 
"I  will  carry  you  down  to  the  camp  in  the  valley,"  said  the man,  and  picked 
him lightly up. 
The man was swift and sure-footed. It was not long before Bilbo was set down 
before  a  tent  in Dale;  and  there  stood Gandalf, with  his  arm  in  a  sling.  Even  the 

####-wizard had not escaped without a wound; and  there were  few unharmed in all the 
host. 
When Gandalf saw Bilbo, he was delighted. "Baggins!" he exclaimed. "Well I 
never! Alive after all – 1 am glad! I began to wonder if even your luck would see 
you through! A terrible business, and it nearly was disastrous. But other news can 
wait. Come!" he said more gravely. "You are called for;" and leading the hobbit he 
took him within the tent. 
"Hail! Thorin," he said as he entered. "I have brought him." 
There  indeed  lay  Thorin  Oakenshield,  wounded  with  many  wounds,  and  his 
rent  armour  and  notched  axe  were  cast  upon  the  floor.  He  looked  up  as  Bilbo 
came beside him. 
"Farewell,  good  thief,"  he  said.  "I  go  now  to  the  halls  of waiting  to  sit  beside 
my  fathers,  until  the world  is  renewed. Since  I  leave  now  all  gold  and  silver,  and 
go  where  it  is  of  little  worth,  I  wish  to  part  in  friendship  from  you,  and  I  would 
take back my words and deeds at the Gate." 
Bilbo  knelt  on  one  knee  filled  with  sorrow.  "Farewell,  King  under  the 
Mountain!"  he  said.  "This  is  a  bitter  adventure,  if  it  must  end  so;  and  not  a 
mountain  of  gold  can  amend  it. Yet  I  am  glad  that  I  have  shared  in  your  perils  – 
that has been more than any Baggins deserves." 
"No!" said Thorin. "There  is more  in you of good  than you know, child of  the 
kindly West. Some  courage  and  some wisdom, blended  in measure.  If more of us 
valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world. 
But sad or merry, I must leave it now. Farewell!" 
Then Bilbo  turned  away,  and  he went  by  himself,  and  sat  alone wrapped  in  a 
blanket, and, whether you believe it or not, he wept until his eyes were red and his 
voice was hoarse. He was a kindly little soul. Indeed it was long before he had the 
heart to make a joke again. "A mercy it is," he said at last to himself, "that I woke 
up when I did. I wish Thorin were living, but I am glad that we parted in kindness. 
You  are  a  fool,  Bilbo  Baggins,  and  you made  a  great mess  of  that  business with 
the stone; and there was a battle, in spite of all your efforts to buy peace and quiet, 
but I suppose you can hardly be blamed for that." 
All  that  had  happened  after  he  was  stunned,  Bilbo  learned  later;  but  it  gave 
him more sorrow than joy, and he was now weary of his adventure. He was aching 
in  his  bones  for  the  homeward  journey. That,  however, was  a  little  delayed, so  in 
the meantime I will tell something of events. The Eagles had long had suspicion of 
the  goblins'  mustering;  from  their  watchfulness  the  movements  in  the  mountains 
could not be altogether hid. So  they  too had gathered  in great numbers, under  the 

####-great  Eagle  of  the Misty Mountains;  and  at  length  smelling  battle  from  afar  they 
had come  speeding down  the gale  in  the nick of  time. They  it was who dislodged 
the  goblins  from  the  mountain-slopes,  casting  them  over  precipices,  or  driving 
them down shrieking and bewildered among their foes. It was not long before they 
had  freed  the  Lonely  Mountain,  and  elves  and  men  on  either  side  of  the  valley 
could come at last to the help of the battle below.  
But even with the Eagles they were still outnumbered. 
In  that  last  hour  Beorn  himself  had  appeared  –  no  one  knew  how  or  from 
where. He  came  alone,  and  in  bear's  shape;  and  he  seemed  to  have  grown  almost 
to  giant-size  in  his wrath. The  roar  of  his  voice was  like  drums  and  guns;  and  he 
tossed  wolves  and  goblins  from  his  path  like  straws  and  feathers.  He  fell  upon 
their  rear,  and  broke  like  a  clap  of  thunder  through  the  ring.  The  dwarves  were 
making  a  stand  still  about  their  lords  upon  a  low  rounded  hill.  Then  Beorn 
stooped and lifted Thorin, who had fallen pierced with spears, and bore him out of 
the  fray.  Swiftly  he  returned  and  his  wrath  was  redoubled,  so  that  nothing  could 
withstand  him,  and  no  weapon  seemed  to  bite  upon  him.  He  scattered  the 
bodyguard,  and  pulled  down Bolg  himself  and  crushed  him. Then  dismay  fell  on 
the  Goblins  and  they  fled  in  all  directions.  But  weariness  left  their  enemies  with 
the  coming  of  new  hope,  and  they  pursued  them  closely,  and  prevented  most  of 
them from escaping where they could. They drove many of them into the Running 
River, and such as fled south or west they hunted into the marshes about the Forest 
River;  and  there  the  greater  part  of  the  last  fugitives  perished,  while  those  that 
came  hardly  to  the Wood-elves'  realm  were  there  slain,  or  drawn  in  to  die  in  the 
trackless  dark  of  Mirkwood.  Songs  have  said  that  three  parts  of  the  goblin 
warriors of the North perished on that day, and the mountains had peace for many 
a year.  
Victory  had  been  assured  before  the  fall  of  night,  but  the  pursuit  was  still  on 
foot, when  Bilbo  returned  to  the  camp;  and not many were  in  the valley  save  the 
more grievously wounded. 
"Where are  the Eagles?" he asked Gandalf  that evening, as he  lay wrapped  in 
many warm blankets. 
"Some  are  in  the  hunt,"  said  the  wizard,  "but  most  have  gone  back  to  their 
eyries.  They  would  not  stay  here,  and  departed  with  the  first  light  of  morning. 
Dain has crowned their chief with gold, and sworn friendship with them for ever." 
"I  am  sorry.  I  mean,  I  should  have  liked  to  see  them  again,"  said  Bilbo 
sleepily;  "perhaps  I  shall  see  them  on  the  way  home.  I  suppose  I  shall  be  going 
home soon?" 

####-"As soon as you like," said the wizard. 
Actually it was some days before Bilbo really set out. 
They buried Thorin deep beneath the Mountain, and Bard laid the Arkenstone 
upon his breast. 
"There let it lie till the Mountain falls!" he said. "May it bring good fortune to 
all his  folk  that dwell here after!" Upon his  tomb  the Elvenking  then  laid Orcrist, 
the  elvish  sword  that  had  been  taken  from  Thorin  in  captivity.  It  is  said  in  songs 
that it gleamed ever in the dark if foes approached, and the fortress of the dwarves 
could  not  be  taken  by  surprise.  There  now  Dain  son  of  Nain  took  up  his  abode, 
and  he  became  King  under  the  Mountain,  and  in  time  many  other  dwarves 
gathered  to  his  throne  in  the  ancient  halls.  Of  the  twelve  companions  of  Thorin, 
ten  remained. Fili  and Kili  had  fallen  defending  him with  shield  and  body,  for  he 
was their mother's elder brother. The others remained with Dain; for Dain dealt his 
treasure well. There was,  of  course,  no  longer  any  question of dividing  the hoard 
in  such  shares  as had been planned,  to Balin  and Dwalin,  and Dori  and Nori  and 
Ori,  and  Oin  and  Gloin,  and  Bifur  and  Bofur  and  Bombur-or  to  Bilbo.  Yet  a 
fourteenth  share of  all  the  silver  and gold, wrought  and unwrought, was given up 
to  Bard;  for  Dain  said:  "We  will  honour  the  agreement  of  the  dead,  and  he  has 
now the Arkenstone in his keeping." 
Even  a  fourteenth  share  was  wealth  exceedingly  great,  greater  than  that  of 
many  mortal  kings.  From  that  treasure  Bard  sent  much  gold  to  the  Master  of 
Lake-town; and he rewarded his followers and friends freely. To the Elvenking he 
gave  the  emeralds  of  Girion,  such  jewels  as  he  most  loved,  which  Dain  had 
restored  to  him.  To  Bilbo  he  said:  "This  treasure  is  as  much  yours  as  it  is  mine; 
though  old  agreements  cannot  stand,  since  so  many  have  a  claim  in  its  winning 
and  defence.  Yet  even  though  you  were  willing  to  lay  aside  all  your  claim,  I 
should wish that the words of Thorin, of which he repented, should not prove true: 
that we should give you little. I would reward you most richly of all." 
"Very  kind  of  you,"  said  Bilbo.  "But  really  it  is  a  relief  to me. How  on  earth 
should  I  have  got  all  that  treasure  home  without  war  and  murder  all  along  the 
way,  I  don't  know. And  I  don't  know what  I  should  have done with  it when  I got 
home. I am sure it is better in your hands." 
In  the end he would only  take  two  small chests, one  filled with  silver, and  the 
other with gold, such as one strong pony could carry. "That will be quite as much 
as I can manage," said he. 
At last the time came for him to say good-bye to his friends. "Farewell, Balin!" 
he  said;  "and  farewell,  Dwalin;  and  farewell  Dori,  Nori,  Ori,  Oin,  Gloin,  Bifur, 

####-Bofur, and Bombur! May your beards never grow  thin!" And  turning  towards  the 
Mountain  he added: "Farewell Thorin Oakenshield! And Fili and Kili! May your 
memory never fade!" 
Then  the  dwarves  bowed  low  before  their  Gate,  but  words  stuck  in  their 
throats.  "Good-bye and good luck, wherever you fare!" said Balin at last. "If ever 
you  visit  us  again,  when  our  halls  are  made  fair  once  more,  then  the  feast  shall 
indeed be splendid!" 
"If  ever  you  are  passing my way,"  said Bilbo,  "don't wait  to  knock!  Tea  is  at 
four; but any of you are welcome at any time!" 
Then he turned away.  
The  elf-host  was  on  the  march;.  and  if  it  was  sadly  lessened,  yet  many  were 
glad,  for  now  the  northern  world  would  be  merrier  for  many  a  long  day.  The 
dragon  was  dead,  and  the  goblins  overthrown,  and  their  hearts  looked  forward 
after winter  to  a  spring  of  joy. Gandalf  and Bilbo  rode behind the Elvenking, and 
beside  them strode Beorn, once again  in man's shape, and he  laughed and sang  in 
a loud voice upon the road. So they went on until they drew near to the borders of 
Mirkwood, to the north of the place where the Forest River ran out. 
Then  they  halted,  for  the  wizard  and  Bilbo  would  not  enter  the  wood,  even 
though the king bade them stay a while in his halls. They intended to go along the 
edge of  the  forest, and  round  its northern end  in  the waste  that  lay between  it and 
the  beginning  of  the  Grey Mountains.  It  was  a  long  and  cheerless  road,  but  now 
that  the goblins were crushed,  it seemed safer  to  them  than  the dreadful pathways 
under the trees. Moreover Beorn was going that way too. 
"Farewell!  O  Elvenking!"  said  Gandalf.  "Merry  be  the  greenwood, while  the 
world is yet young! And merry be all your folk!" 
"Farewell!  O  Gandalf!"  said  the  king.  "May  you  ever  appear  where  you  are 
most  needed  and  least  expected!  The  oftener  you  appear  in  my  halls  the  better 
shall I be pleased!" 
"I beg of  you," said Bilbo stammering and standing on one foot, "to accept this 
gift!" and he brought out a necklace of  silver and pearls  that Dain had given him 
at their parting. 
"In what way have I earned such a gift, O hobbit?" said the king. 
"Well,  er,  I  thought,  don't  you  know,"  said  Bilbo  rather  confused,  "that,  er, 
some  little  return  should  be made  for  your,  er,  hospitality.  I mean  even  a  burglar 
has his feelings. I have drunk much of your wine and eaten much of your bread." 

####-"I will  take your gift, O Bilbo  the Magnificent!" said the king gravely. "And I 
name  you  elf-friend  and  blessed. May  your  shadow  never  grow  less  (or  stealing 
would be too easy)! Farewell!" 
Then  the  elves  turned  towards  the  Forest,  and  Bilbo  started  on  his  long  road 
home. 
He had many hardships and adventures before he got back. The Wild was still 
the Wild, and there were many other things in it in those days besides goblins; but 
he  was  well  guided  and  well  guarded-the  wizard  was  with  him,  and  Beorn  for 
much  of  the way-and  he was  never  in  great danger again. Anyway by mid-winter 
Gandalf  and Bilbo had  come  all  the way back,  along both  edges of  the Forest,  to 
the  doors  of Beorn's  house;  and  there  for  a while  they  both  stayed. Yule-tide was 
warm  and  merry  there;  and  men  came  from  far  and  wide  to  feast  at  Beorn's 
bidding.  The  goblins  of  the  Misty  Mountains  were  now  few  and  terrified,  and 
hidden  in  the deepest holes  they could  find; and  the Wargs had vanished  from  the 
woods,  so  that men went  abroad without  fear. Beorn  indeed became  a great  chief 
afterwards  in  those  regions  and  ruled  a wide  land between  the mountains  and  the 
wood; and it is said that for many generations the men of his line had the power of 
taking bear's shape, and some were grim men and bad, but most were in heart like 
Beorn,  if  less  in  size  and  strength.  In  their  day  the  last  goblins were  hunted  from 
the  Misty  Mountains  and  a  new  peace  came  over  the  edge  of  the  Wild.  It  was 
spring,  and  a  fair  one  with  mild  weathers  and  a  bright  sun,  before  Bilbo  and 
Gandalf  took  their  leave  at  last  of Beorn,  and  though  he  longed  for  home. Bilbo 
left with regret, for the flowers of the gardens of Beorn were m springtime no less 
marvellous  than  in high summer. At  last  they came up  the  long road, and reached 
the  very  pass  where  the  goblins  had  captured  them before. But  they came  to  that 
high  point  at morning,  and  looking  backward  they  saw  a  white  sun  shining  over 
the  out-stretched  lands.  There  behind  lay  Mirkwood,  blue  in  the  distance,  and 
darkly green at the nearer edge even in the spring. There far away was the Lonely 
Mountain  on  the  edge  of  eyesight.  On  its  highest  peak  snow  yet  unmelted  was 
gleaming pale. 
"So  comes  snow  after  fire,  and  even  dragons  have  their  ending!"  said  Bilbo, 
and he  turned his back on his adventure. The Tookish part was getting very tired, 
and  the  Baggins  was  daily  getting  stronger.  "I  wish  now  only  to  be  in  my  own 
arm-chair!" he said. 

####-<h4>Chapter 19</h4> <br> 

The Last Stage 

 
It was on May the First that the two came back at last to the brink of the valley 
of  Rivendell,  where  stood  the  Last  (or  the  First)  Homely  House.  Again  it  was 
evening,  their  ponies were  tired,  especially  the  one  that  carried  the  baggage;  and 
they all felt in need of rest. As they rode down the steep path, Bilbo heard the elves 
still  singing  in  the  trees,  as  if  they  had  not  stopped  since  he  left;  and  as  soon  as 
their riders came down into the lower glades of the wood they burst into a song of 
much the same kind as before. This is something like it: 
 

The dragon is withered, 
His bones are now crumbled; 
His armour is shivered, 
His splendour is humbled! 
Though sword shall be rusted, 
And throne and crown perish  
With strength that men trusted 
And wealth that they cherish, 
Here grass is still growing, 
And leaves are yet swinging, 
The white water flowing, 
And elves are yet singing 
Come! Tra-la-la-lally! 
Come back to the valley! 
 
The stars are far brighter 
Than gems without measure, 
The moon is far whiter 
Than silver in treasure: 
The fire is more shining 
On hearth in the gloaming 
Than gold won by mining, 
So why go a -roaming? 
O! Tra-la-la-lally 
Come back to the Valley.  
 
O! Where are you going, 

####-So late in returning? 
The river is flowing, 
The stars are all burning! 
O! Whither so laden, 
So sad and so dreary? 
Here elf and elf-maiden 
Now welcome the weary 
With Tra-la-la-lally 
Come back to the Va lley,  
Tra-la-la-lally 
Fa-la-la-lally 
Fa-la! 

 
Then  the  elves  of  the  valley  came  out  and  greeted  them  and  led  them  across 
the  water  to  the  house  of  Elrond.  There  a  warm  welcome  was  made  them,  and 
there  were  many  eager  ears  that  evening  to  hear  the  tale  of  their  adventures. 
Gandalf it was who spoke, for Bilbo was fallen quiet and drowsy. Most of the tale 
he  knew,  for  he  had  been  in  it,  and  had  himself  told much  of  it  to  the  wizard  on 
their homeward way or  in  the house of Beorn; but every now and again he would 
open one eye, and listen, when a part of the story which he did not yet know came 
in. It was in this way that he learned where Gandalf had been to; for he overheard 
the  words  of  the  wizard  to  Elrond.  It  appeared  that  Gandalf  had  been  to  a  great 
council of the white wizards, masters of lore and good magic; and that they had at 
last driven the Necromancer from his dark hold in the south of Mirkwood. 
"Ere  long  now,"  Gandalf  was  saying,  "The  Forest  will  grow  somewhat  more 
wholesome. The North will be freed from that horror for many long years, I hope. 
Yet I wish he were banished from the world!" 
"It would be well  indeed," said Elrond; "but I fear  that will not come about  in 
this age of the world, or for many after." 
When  the  tale  of  their  joumeyings  was  told,  there  were  other  tales,  and  yet 
more  tales,  tales of  long ago, and  tales  . of new  things, and  tales of no  time at all, 
till Bilbo's head fell forward on his chest, and he snored comfortably in a corner.  
He woke to find himself in a white bed, and the moon shining through an open 
window.  Below  it  many  elves  were  singing  loud  and  clear  on  the  banks  of  the 
stream. 
 

Sing all ye joyful, now sing all together?  
The wind's in the free-top, the wind's in the heather;  
The stars are in blossom, the moon is in flower,  

####-And bright are the windows of Night in her tower.  
 
Dance all ye joyful, now dance all together! 
Soft is the grass, and let foot be like feather! 
The river is silver, the shadows are fleeting; 
Merry is May-time, and merry our meeting. 
 
Sing we now softly, and dreams let us weave him! 
Wind him in slumber and there let us leave him! 
The wanderer sleepeth. Now soft be his pillow! 
Lullaby! Lullaby! Alder and Willow! 
 
Sigh no more Pine, till the wind of the morn! 
Fall Moon! Dark be the land! 
Hush! Hush! Oak, Ash, and Thorn! 
Hushed be all water, till dawn is at hand! 

 
"Well, Merry People!" said Bilbo looking out. "What time by the moon is this? 
Your lullaby would waken a drunken goblin! Yet I thank you." 
"And  your  snores  would  waken  a  stone  dragon  –  yet  we  thank  you,"  they 
answered  with  laughter.  "It  is  drawing    towards  dawn,  and  you  have  slept  now 
since the night's beginning. Tomorrow, perhaps, you will be cured of weariness." 
"A  little  sleep  does  a  great  cure  in  the  house  of  Elrond,"  said  he;  "but  I  will 
take  all  the  cure  I  can  get.  A  second  good  night,  fair  friends!"  And  with  that  he 
went back to bed and slept till late morning. 
Weariness fell from him soon in that house, and he had many a merry jest and 
dance,  early  and  late,  with  the  elves  of  the  valley.  Yet  even  that  place  could  not 
long  delay  him  now,  and  he  thought  always  of  his  own  home.  After  a  week, 
therefore, he said farewell  to Elrond, and giving him such small gifts as he would 
accept, he  rode  away with Gandalf. Even  as  they  left  the valley  the  sky darkened 
in the West before them, and wind and rain came up to meet them. 
"Merry  is May-time!" said Bilbo, as  the  rain beat  into his  face. "But our back 
is to legends and we are coming home. I suppose this is a first taste of it." 
"There is a long road yet," said Gandalf. 
"But  it  is  the  last  road,"  said  Bilbo.  They  came  to  the  river  that  marked  the 
very  edge  of  the  borderland  of  the Wild,  and  to  the  ford  beneath  the  steep  bank, 
which  you  may  remember.  The  water  was  swollen  both  with  the  melting  of  the 
snows  at  the  approach  of  summer,  and  with  the  daylong  rain;  but  they  crossed 
with some difficulty, and pressed forward, as evening fell, on the last stage of their 

####-journey.  This  was  much  as  it  had  been  before,  except  that  the  company  was 
smaller,  and  more  silent;  also  this  time  there were  no  trolls. At  each  point  on  the 
road Bilbo  recalled  the  happenings  and  the words  of  a  year  ago-it seemed  to him 
more  like  ten-so  that,  of  course,  he  quickly  noted  the  place  where  the  pony  had 
fallen  in  the  river,  and  they  had  turned  aside  for  their  nasty  adventure with  Tom 
and  Bert  and  Bill. Not  far  from  the  road  they  found  the  gold  of  the  trolls, which 
they had buried,  still hidden  and untouched.  "I have  enough  to  last me my  time," 
said Bilbo, when they had dug it up. "You had better take this, Gandalf. I daresay 
you can find a use for it." 
"Indeed I can!" said the wizard. "But share and share alike! You may find you 
have more needs than you expect." 
So they put the gold in bags and slung them on the ponies, who were not at all 
pleased  about  it.  After  that  their  going  was  slower,  for  most  of  the  time  they 
walked.  But  the  land  was  green  and  there  was  much  grass  through  which  the 
hobbit  strolled  along  contentedly.  He  mopped  his  face  with  a  red  silk 
handkerchief-no!  not  a  single  one  of  his own had  survived, he had borrowed  this 
one from Elrond  –for now June had brought summer, and  the weather was bright 
and hot again. 
As  all  things  come  to  an  end,  even  this  story,  a  day  came  at  last  when  they 
were in sight of the country where Bilbo had been born and bred, where the shapes 
of  the  land  and  of  the  trees  were  as  well  known  to  him  as  his  hands  and  toes. 
Coming  to  a  rise  he  could  see  his  own  Hill  in  the  distance,  and  he  stopped 
suddenly and said: 
 

Roads go ever ever on, 
Over rock and under tree, 
By caves where never sun has shone, 
By streams that never find the sea; 
 
Over snow by winter sown, 
And through the merry flowers of June, 
Over grass and over stone, 
And under mountains in the moon. 
 
Roads go ever ever on 
Under cloud and under star,  
Yet feet that wandering have gone 
Turn at last to home afar.  
 

####-Eyes that fire and sword have seen 
And horror in the halls of stone 
Look at last on meadows green 
And trees and hills they long have known. 

 
Gandalf  looked  at  him.  "My  dear  Bilbo!"  he  said.  "Something  is  the  matter 
with you! You are not the hobbit that you were." 
And so they crossed the bridge and passed the mill by the river and came right 
back  to  Bilbo's  own  door.  "Bless  me!  What's  going  on?"  he  cried.  There  was  a 
great  commotion,  and  people  of  all  sorts,  respectable  and  unrespectable,  were 
thick  round  the  door,  and many were  going  in  and  out-not even wiping  their  feet 
on the mat, as Bilbo noticed with annoyance. 
If he was surprised,  they were more surprised still. He had arrived back  in  the 
middle  of an auction! There was a large notice in black and red hung on the gate, 
stating  that  on  June  the  Twenty-second  Messrs.  Grubb,  Grubb,  and  Bun-owes 
would  sell  by  auction  the  effects  of  the  late  Bilbo  Baggins  Esquire,  of  Bag-End, 
Underhill,  Hobbiton.  Sale  to  commence  at  ten  o'clock  sharp.  It  was  now  nearly 
lunch-time,  and most  of  the  things  had  already  been  sold,  for  various  prices  from 
next  to  nothing  to  old  songs  (as  is  not  unusual  at  auctions).  Bilbo's  cousins  the 
Sackville-Bagginses  were,  in  fact,  busy  measuring  his  rooms  to  see  if  their  own 
furniture would  fit.  In  short Bilbo was  "Presumed Dead,"  and not  everybody  that 
said so was sorry to find the presumption wrong. 
The  return  of  Mr.  Bilbo  Baggins  created  quite  a  disturbance,  both  under  the 
Hill  and  over  the Hill, and across  the Water;  it was a great deal more  than a nine 
days' wonder.  The  legal  bother,  indeed,  lasted  for  years.  It was  quite  a  long  time 
before Mr. Baggins was in fact admitted to be alive again. The people who had got 
specially  good  bargains  at  the  Sale  took  a  deal  of  convincing;  and  in  the  end  to 
sav6  time  Bilbo  had  to  buy  back  quite  a  lot  of  his  own  furniture.  Many  of  his 
silver  spoons mysteriously  disappeared  and were  never  accounted  for.  Personally 
he  suspected  the  Sackville-Bagginses.  On  their  side  they  never  admitted  that  the 
returned  Baggins  was  genuine,  and  they  were  not  on  friendly  terms  with  Bilbo 
ever after. They really had wanted to live in his nice hobbit-hole so very much. 
Indeed Bilbo  found he had  lost more  than  spoons  – he had lost his reputation. 
It  is  true  that  for  ever  after  he  remained  an  elf-friend,  and  had  the  honour  of 
dwarves, wizards, and all such folk as ever passed that way; but he was no longer 
quite  respectable.  He  was  in  fact  held  by  all  the  hobbits  of  the  neighbourhood to 
be  'queer'-except by his nephews and nieces on  the Took  side, but even  they were 
not  encouraged  in  their  friendship  by  their  elders.  I  am  sorry  to  say  he  did  not 

####-mind.  He  was  quite  content;  and  the  sound  of  the  kettle  on  his  hearth  was  ever 
after more musical  than  it had been  even  in  the quiet days before  the Unexpected 
Party. His sword he hung over  the mantelpiece. His coat of mail was arranged on 
a  stand  in  the hall  (until he  lent  it  to  a Museum). His gold  and  silver was  largely 
spent in presents, both useful and extravagant – which to a certain extent accounts 
for  the  affection  of  his  nephews  and  his  nieces.  His  magic  ring  he  kept  a  great 
secret,  for  he  chiefly  used  it  when  unpleasant  callers  came.  He  took  to  writing 
poetry  and  visiting  the  elves;  and  though  many  shook  their  heads  and  touched 
their  foreheads  and  said  "Poor  old Baggins!"  and  though  few  believed  any  of  his 
tales,  he  remained  very  happy  to  the  end  of  his  days,  and  those  were 
extraordinarily long. 
One  autumn  evening  some  years  afterwards  Bilbo  was  sitting  in  his  study 
writing  his  memoirs  –  he  thought  of  calling  them  "There  and  Back  Again,  a 
Hobbit's  Holiday"  –  when  there  was  a  ring  at  the  door.  It  was  Gandalf  and  a 
dwarf; and the dwarf was actually Balin. 
"Come  in!  Come  in!"  said  Bilbo,  and  soon  they  were  settled  in  chairs  by  the 
fire. If Balin noticed that Mr. Baggins' waistcoat was more extensive (and had real 
gold buttons), Bilbo also noticed that Balm's beard was several inches longer, and 
his jewelled belt was of great magnificence. 
They  fell  to  talking  of  their  times  together,  of  course,  and  Bilbo  asked  how 
things  were  going  in  the  lands  of  the Mountain.  It  seemed  they  were  going  very 
well.  Bard  had  rebuilt  the  town  in  Dale  and  men  had  gathered  to  him  from  the 
Lake  and  from  South  and  West,  and  all  the  valley  had  become  tilled  again  and 
rich, and the desolation was now filled with birds and blossoms in spring and fruit 
and  feasting  in  autumn. And Lake-town was refounded and was more prosperous 
than  ever,  and much wealth went  up  and down the Running River; and there was 
friendship in those parts between elves and dwarves and men. 
The old Master had come to a bad end. Bard had given him much gold for the 
help  of  the  Lake-people,  but  being  of  the  kind  that  easily  catches  such  disease  he 
fell under the dragon-sickness, and took most of the gold and fled with it, and died 
of starvation in the Waste, deserted by his companions. 
"The  new  Master  is  of  wiser  kind,"  said  Balin,  "and  very  popular,  for,  of 
course,  he  gets  most  of  the  credit  for  the  present  prosperity.  They  are  making 
songs which say that in his day the rivers run with gold." 
"Then  the  prophecies  of  the  old  songs  have  turned  out  to  be  true,  after  a 
fashion!" said Bilbo. 

####-"Of  course!"  said Gandalf.  "And why  should  not  they  prove  true? Surely you 
don't  disbelieve  the  prophecies,  because  you  had  a  hand  in  bringing  them  about 
yourself? You  don't  really  suppose,  do  you,  that  all  your  adventures  and  escapes 
were  managed  by  mere  luck,  just  for  your  sole  benefit?  You  are  a  very  fine 
person,  Mr.  Baggins,  and  I  am  very  fond  of  you;  but  you  are  only  quite  a  little 
fellow in a wide world after all!" 
"Thank goodness!" said Bilbo laughing, and handed him the tobacco-jar.

####-Foreword 

 
 
     This  tale grew in the telling, until it became  a history of the Great 
War of the  Ring and included  many glimpses of the yet more ancient history 
that preceded it. It was begun soon after The  Hobbit was written and before 
its publication in 1937; but I did not go  on with this sequel, for I wished 
first  to complete and set in  order the mythology and  legends of the Elder  
Days, which had then been taking shape for some years. I desired to do  this 
for my own satisfaction,  and  I had little hope that other people would  be 
interested  in  this work, especially  since it was primarily  linguistic in 
inspiration and  was begun  in order to provide  the necessary background of 
'history' for Elvish tongues. 
     When  those  whose advice and opinion I sought corrected little hope to 
no hope, I went back to the sequel, encouraged by  requests from readers for  
more information concerning hobbits and their adventures. But the story  was 
drawn  irresistibly  towards the  older world, and became an account,  as it 
were, of its end and passing away  before its beginning and middle had  been 
told. The process  had begun  in the writing  of The Hobbit, in which  there 
were  already  some  references to the older  matter:  Elrond, Gondolin, the 
High-elves, and the  orcs,  as  well as glimpses that had arisen unbidden of 
things higher or deeper  or darker than its surface: Durin,  Moria, Gandalf, 
the Necromancer,  the  Ring.  The  discovery  of the significance  of  these 
glimpses and of  their relation to  the ancient histories revealed the Third 
Age and its culmination in the War of the Ring. 
     Those who  had asked for  more information about hobbits eventually got  
it, but they had to wait a long time; for the composition of The Lord of the 
Rings went on at intervals during the  years 1936 to 1949, a period in which  
I had  many  duties that  I did not neglect, and  many  other interests as a  
learner and teacher  that often absorbed  me. The delay was, of course, also 
increased by the outbreak of war in 1939, by the end of which  year the tale 
had not yet reached  the  end  of Book  One. In spite of the darkness of the 
next  five years I  found that the story could  not now be  wholly abandoned,  
and  I plodded on, mostly  by night, till I stood  by Balin's tomb in Moria. 
There I halted for a long while. It  was almost a  year later when I went on 
and so came to Lothlurien and the Great River late in 1941. In the next year  

####-I  wrote the first drafts of the  matter  that now stands as Book Three, and 
the beginnings of  chapters I and III of Book Five; and there as the beacons 
flared in  Anurien  and Thjoden came to Harrowdale I stopped.  Foresight had 
failed and there was no time for thought. 
     It was  during 1944  that, leaving the loose ends and perplexities of a  
war which it was my task to  conduct, or at least to report, 1 forced myself 
to tackle the journey of Frodo  to  Mordor.  These chapters,  eventually  to 
become  Book Four,  were  written  and  sent  out  as  a  serial  to my son, 
Christopher, then in South Africa with the RAF.  Nonetheless it took another 
five  years before the tale was brought to its present end;  in that  time I 
changed my house, my chair,  and my college,  and the days though  less dark 
were no less laborious.  Then when the 'end' had  at last  been reached  the 
whole story had to be revised, and indeed  largely re-written backwards. And 
it had to be typed, and  re-typed: by me; the cost of professional typing by 
the ten-fingered was beyond my means. 
     The Lord of the  Rings has been read by many  people since  it  finally 
appeared in print; and I should like to say something here with reference to 
the many opinions  or guesses that I  have  received or have read concerning 
the motives  and meaning  of  the tale. The prime motive was the desire of a  
tale-teller  to try  his hand at a  really long  story that would  hold  the 
attention  of  readers, amuse them, delight  them, and at times maybe excite 
them or deeply move them. As a guide I had only my own  feelings for what is 
appealing or moving, and for  many the guide  was inevitably often at fault. 
Some who have read the book, or at  any rate have reviewed it, have found it 
boring, absurd, or contemptible; and I have no  cause  to complain, since  I 
have similar opinions of  their works, or of the kinds  of writing that they 
evidently  prefer. But even from the points of view of many who have enjoyed 
my story there is much that fails to please. It is perhaps not possible in a  
long tale to please everybody at  all  points, nor to displease everybody at 
the same points; for I find from the letters that I have  received  that the 
passages or chapters that are to some a blemish  are all by others specially 
approved. The  most critical  reader of all, myself, now finds many defects,  
minor and major, but  being fortunately under no obligation either to review 
the book  or  to write  it again, he will pass over these in  silence, except 
one that has been noted by others: the book is too short. 
     As for any inner meaning or  'message', it has in the intention  of the 
author none. It is neither allegorical nor topical. As the story grew it put 

####-down roots  (into the past) and threw out unexpected branches: but  its main 
theme was  settled from  the outset by the  inevitable choice of the Ring as 
the link between it and  The Hobbit. The crucial chapter, "The Shadow of the 
Past', is  one of the oldest parts of the tale.  It  was written long before 
the foreshadow  of  1939 had yet become a threat of inevitable disaster, and 
from that  point the  story would have developed along essentially  the same 
lines, if that disaster had been averted. Its sources are things long before 
in mind, or in some  cases already written, and  little or nothing in it was 
modified by the war that began in 1939 or its sequels.  
     The real war  does not resemble the legendary war in its process or its 
conclusion. If it had inspired  or  directed  the development of the legend, 
then certainly the  Ring would have  been seized and used against Sauron; he 
would  not have been annihilated  but enslaved, and Barad-dyr would not have 
been destroyed but occupied. Saruman, failing to get possession of the Ring, 
would m the confusion  and treacheries of the  time have found in Mordor the 
missing links in his own researches into Ring-lore, and before long he would 
have made a Great  Ring  of his  own with which to challenge the self-styled 
Ruler of Middle-earth.  In that conflict both sides would  have held hobbits 
in hatred and contempt: they would not long have survived even as slaves. 
     Other arrangements could be devised according to the tastes or views of 
those  who  like allegory  or  topical reference.  But I  cordially  dislike 
allegory in all its manifestations, and always have done so since I grew old 
and  wary  enough to  detect  its  presence. I  much prefer history, true or  
feigned, with its varied  applicability  to the  thought  and  experience of 
readers. I think that many confuse 'applicability' with 'allegory'; but  the 
one  resides  in the  freedom of the reader, and the  other in  the purposed 
domination of the author. 
     An author cannot of course remain wholly unaffected  by his experience,  
but the ways in which a story-germ uses the soil of experience are extremely  
complex,  and  attempts  to  define  the  process  are at  best guesses from 
evidence  that  is  inadequate  and  ambiguous.  It  is also  false,  though 
naturally  attractive,  when  the  lives  of   an  author  and  critic  have 
overlapped, to  suppose that the movements of thought or the events of times 
common to both were necessarily the most powerful influences. One has 
indeed 
personally to come under the shadow of war to feel fully its oppression; but 
as the years go by it seems now often forgotten that to  be caught  in youth 

####-by  1914 was no less hideous an experience  than to  be involved in 1939 and 
the  following years. By 1918 all but one of my close  friends were dead. Or  
to  take  a less grievous  matter:  it  has been supposed by some  that 'The 
Scouring of  the Shire' reflects the situation in England at the time when I 
was finishing  my tale. It does  not. It is an  essential  part of the plot, 
foreseen from the outset, though in the event  modified  by the character of 
Saruman as  developed  in  the story  without, need I  say,  any allegorical 
significance or contemporary political reference  whatsoever. It has  indeed 
some basis in experience,  though  slender (for the  economic situation  was 
entirely different),  and much further back. The country in which I lived in 
childhood was  being  shabbily  destroyed before  I was  ten, in  days  when 
motor -cars were  rare objects  (I had  never seen  one) and  men wer e  still 
building suburban railways.  Recently I saw in a paper a picture of the last  
decrepitude of  the once  thriving  corn-mill beside its  pool that long ago 
seemed to me so important.  I never liked the looks of the Young miller, but 
his father,  the Old  miller,  had  a  black  beard,  and he  was  not named 
Sandyman. 
     The  Lord  of  the  Rings is  now  issued in  a  new  edition,  and the 
opportunity  has  been  taken  of  revising  it.  A  number  of  errors  and 
inconsistencies that still rema ined in  the text have been corrected, and an 
attempt has been made to provide information on a few points which attentive 
readers have raised. I have considered all their comments and enquiries, and 
if some seem to have been passed over  that  may be because I have failed to  
keep  my  notes in  order;  but many  enquiries  could only  be answered  by  
additional appendices, or indeed  by the  production  of an accessory volume  
containing  much of  the material that I did not  include  in  the  original 
edition, in particular more detailed linguistic information. In the meantime 
this edition offers this Foreword, an  addition to the Prologue, some notes,  
and an index of the names of persons and places. This index is in  intention 
complete in items  but not in references,  since for the present  purpose it 
has been  necessary to reduce its bulk. A complete index, making full use of 
the  material  prepared  for  me  by Mrs.  N. Smith,  belongs  rather to the 
accessory volume.

1. Concerning Hobbits 

 
 
     This  book  is largely  concerned  with  Hobbits, and from its pages  a  
reader  may discover  much of their character and a little of their history. 
Further information will also be found in the selection from the Red Book of 
Westmarch  that has already been published, under the  title of The  Hobbit. 
That story  was derived  from the earlier chapters of the Red Book, composed 
by  Bilbo himself, the first Hobbit to become famous in  the world at large, 
and called by him There and  Back Again, since they told of his journey into 
the East and his  return: an adventure  which later involved all the Hobbits 
in the great events of that Age that are here related. 
     Many, however, may wish to know more about  this remarkable people 
from 
the outset, whi le some  may not possess the earlier book. For such readers a  
few notes on the more important points are here  collected from Hobbit-lore,  
and the first adventure is briefly recalled. 
     Hobbits are  an  unobtrusive  but  very  ancient  people, more numerous 
formerly than they are today; for they love peace and quiet and  good tilled 
earth: a well-ordered and well-farmed countryside was their favourite haunt. 
They do not and did not understand or like machines more  complicated than a  
forge-bellows, a water -mill, or a  hand-loom, though  they were skilful with  
tools. Even in ancient days they  were, as a rule, shy of 'the Big Folk', as 
they call us, and now  they avoid us with  dismay and are  becoming hard  to  
find. They are quick of hearing and sharp-eyed, and though they are inclined  
to be  fat  and do not hurry unnecessarily, they are nonetheless  nimble and 
deft  in  their  movements.  They  possessed  from  the  first  the  art  of 
disappearing  swiftly and silently, when large folk whom they do not wish to 
meet come blundering by; and this an they have developed until to Men it may 
seem  magical. But Hobbits have never, in  fact,  studied magic of any kind,  
and their elusiveness  is due  solely to a professional skill  that heredity 
and  practice,  and  a  close  friendship  with  the  earth,  have  rendered 

####-inimitable by bigger and clumsier races.  
     For  they are  a  little people,  smaller  than Dwarves:  less tout and 
stocky, that is, even when they  are not actually much shorter. Their height 
is  variable, ranging between two and  four feet of our measure. They seldom 
now reach three feet; but they hive dwindled, they  say, and in ancient days 
they were  taller. According to the Red Book,  Bandobras Took  (Bullroarer), 
son of Isengrim the Second,  was four foot five and able to ride a  horse. He 
was  surpassed  in all Hobbit records only by two famous characters of  old;  
but that curious matter is dealt with in this book. 
     As for the Hobbits of the  Shire,  with whom these tales are concerned, 
in  the  days  of their peace and prosperity they  were  a  merry folk. They 
dressed in bright colours, being notably fond of yellow and green;  but they 
seldom wore shoes, since  their feet had tough leathery soles  and were clad 
in  a  thick  curling hair, much like  the hair  of  their  heads, which was 
commonly  brown.  Thus,  the  only  craft  little  practised among them  was 
shoe-making; but they had long and skilful fingers and could make many other 
useful and comely  things.  Their faces  were as  a rule good-natured rather  
than  beautiful,  broad,  bright-eyed,  red-cheeked,  with  mouths   apt  to 
laughter,  and to eating and  drinking. And laugh  they  did,  and  eat, and 
drink, often and heartily, being fond  of simple  jests at all times, and of 
six meals  a  day (when  they  could  get them).  They  were  hospitable and 
delighted in  parties, and  in  presents, which  they  gave away freely  and 
eagerly accepted. 
     It  is plain indeed that  in spite  of later  estrangement Hobbits  are 
relatives of ours: far nearer to us than Elves, or even than Dwarves. Of old 
they spoke  the languages  of Men,  after their own fashion,  and liked  and 
disliked much  the same things as Men did. But what exactly our relationship 
is  can no longer be discovered. The  beginning of Hobbits lies  far back in 
the  Elder Days that  are  now  lost and  forgotten.  Only  the Elves  still 
preserve any  records  of  that  vanished  time, and  their  traditions  are 
concerned almost entirely with their own history, in which Men appear seldom 
and Hobbits are not mentioned at  all. Yet it is clear that Hobbits  had, in 
fact, lived quietly in  Middle-earth for  many  long years before other folk  
became  even aware of  them.  And the world being after all  full of strange 
creatures   beyond  count,  these  little  people   seemed  of  very  little 
importance. But in the days of Bilbo, and  of Frodo his  heir, they suddenly 
became, by no wish of  their  own, both important and renowned, and troubled 

####-the counsels of the Wise and  the Great. 
     Those days,  the Third Age of Middle-earth, are now long past, and  the 
shape  of all lands has  been changed; but the regions in which Hobbits then  
lived were doubtless  the  same  as  those  in which  they still linger: the 
North-West  of the  Old World, east of  the Sea. Of their original home  the 
Hobbits in Bilbo's time preserved no  knowledge. A  love  of learning (other  
than genealogical lore) was far from general among them,  but there remained 
still a few  in  the  older families  who  studied their own books, and even 
gathered reports  of old times and distant lands  from Elves,  Dwarves,  and 
Men. Their own  records  began only  after the settlement of the  Shire, and 
their most ancient  legends hardly looked further  back than their Wandering  
Days. It is clear, nonetheless, from these legends, and from the evidence of 
their peculiar words  and customs, that like many other  folk Hobbits had in 
the distant past moved westward. Their earliest tales seem to glimpse a time 
when they dwelt in the upper vales of Anduin, between the eaves of 
Greenwood 
the Great  and the Misty Mountains. Why they  later undertook  the hard  and 
perilous crossing of the mountains into Eriador is no longer  certain. Their 
own  accounts speak  of the multiplying of Men in  the land, and of a shadow 
that fell on the forest,  so that it became  darkened  and its new  name was 
Mirkwood. 
     Before the  crossing  of the  mountains the Hobbits had  already become 
divided  into  three  somewhat   different  breeds:  Harfoots,  Stoors,  and 
Fallohides. The Harfoots were  browner  of skin, smaller,  and  shorter, and 
they were beardless and bootless; their hands and feet were neat and nimble;  
and they preferred highlands and hillsides. The Stoors were broader, heavier  
in build; their feet  and hands were larger,  and they preferred flat  lands 
and riversides.  The Fallohides  were fairer of  skin and also of  hair, and 
they were taller and slimmer than the others; they were lovers of  trees and 
of woodlands.  
     The  Harfoots had  much  to do  with Dwarves in ancient times, and long 
lived in the  foothills  of  the  mountains. They moved westward early,  and 
roamed over Eriador as far as Weathertop while the  others were still in the 
Wilderland. They were the most normal  and representative variety of Hobbit, 
and  far  the most  numerous. They  were the most inclined to settle  in one 
place, and longest preserved their ancestral habit of living in  tunnels and 
holes. 

####-     The Stoors lingered long by  the  banks of  the Great River Anduin, and 
were less shy of Men.  They came west after  the  Harfoots and  followed the 
course of the  Loudwater  southwards;  and  there  many of  them  long dwelt 
between Tharbad and the borders of Dunland before they moved north again. 
     The  Fallohides, the least numerous, were a northerly branch. They were 
more friendly with Elves  than the other Hobbits were, and had more skill in 
language  and song than in handicrafts; and of old they preferred hunting to 
tilling.  They  crossed the mountains north of Rivendell  and came  down the  
River Hoarwell. In  Eriador they soon  mingled with the other kinds that had 
preceded them,  but being somewhat  bolder  and more adventurous, they  were 
often found as leaders or chieftains among clans of Harfoots or Stoors. Even 
in Bilbo's time the strong Fallohidish strain could still be noted among the 
greater families, such as the Tooks and the Masters of Buckland. 
     In the  westlands  of Eriador, between  the  Misty  Mountains  and  the 
Mountains of  Lune, the Hobbits found both Men and Elves. Indeed, a  remnant 
still dwelt there of the D®nedain, the kings of Men that  came over the  Sea  
out of  Westernesse; but  they were  dwindling fast and  the  lands of their 
North Kingdom were falling far and  wide into waste. There was  room and  to 
spare for  incomers, and ere long  the Hobbits began  to  settle in  ordered 
communities. Most of their earlier settlements had long disappeared and been 
forgotten in Bilbo's time;  but  one of the  first to become important still 
endured, though reduced in  size; this  was at Bree and in the Chetwood that 
lay round about, some forty miles east of the Shire. 
     It was in these  early days,  doubtless, that the Hobbits learned their 
letters and  began to write  after  the  manner  of the D®nedain, who had in 
their  turn long before learned  the art from  the Elves. And in  those days 
also they  forgot  whatever languages  they had used before,  and spoke ever  
after the  Common  Speech, the  Westron as it  was  named, that was  current 
through all the lands of the kings  from Arnor to  Gondor, and about all the 
coasts of the Sea from Belfalas to Lune. Yet they kept  a few words of their 
own,  as  well as their own names of months  and days, and  a great store of 
personal names out of the past. 
     About this time legend among  the Hobbits first  becomes history with a  
reckoning  of years. For it was in the  one thousand  six hundred  and first  
year of the  Third Age  that the  Fallohide brothers, Marcho and Blanco, set 
out  from  Bree; and having  obtained  permission  from  the  high  king  at 
Fornost1,  they crossed the brown river Baranduin with a  great following of 

####-Hobbits.  They passed over the Bridge of Stonebows, that had been  built  in 
the  days  of the  power of the North Kingdom,  and they took ail  the  land 
beyond  to  dwell in,  between  the river and  the Far Downs.  All  that was 
demanded of them was  that they should keep the Great Bridge in  repair, and 
all other bridges  and roads,  speed the king's messengers, and  acknowledge 
his lordship. 
     Thus began  the Shire-reckoning, for the year  of  the  crossing of the 
Brandywine (as the  Hobbits turned the name) became  Year One  of the Shire, 
and all later dates were reckoned from it.2 At once the western Hobbits fell 
in love with their new land, and they  remained there, and soon passed  once 
more out  of the history  of Men and of Elves. While there  was still a king 
they  were in name his subjects, but they were, in  fact, ruled by their own 
chieftains  and meddled not at all with events in the world outside. To  the 
last  battle at Fornost with the Witch -lord of Angmar they  sent some bowmen 
to the aid of the king, or so they maintained, though no tales of Men record 
it.  But in that war the North Kingdom ended; and then the  Hobbits took the 
land for their own, and they chose from their own chiefs a Thain to hold the 
authority of the king that  was  gone. There for a thousand years  they were 
little troubled  by wars, and  they prospered and  multiplied after the Dark 
Plague (S.R. 37) until the disaster of  the Long Winter and the famine  that 
followed it. Many thousands then  perished, but the Days of Dearth (1158-60) 
were at the time of this  tale long past and  the Hobbits  had again  become 
accustomed  to plenty. The land  was rich and kindly, and though it had long 
been deserted  when they entered it,  it  had  before been  well tilled, and 
there the king had once had many farms, cornlands, vineyards, and woods.  
     Forty leagues it stretched from the Far Downs to the Brandywine Bridge, 
and fifty from the northern moors to  the marshes in the south. The  Hobbits 
named  it  the Shire, as the region of the  authority of their Thain,  and a  
district of well-ordered  business; and there  in that pleasant  comer of the 
world they plied their well-ordered business of living, and they heeded less 
and less the world outside where dark things moved, until they came to think 
that  peace and  plenty were the rule in Middle-earth and the  right of  all 
sensible folk. They forgot or ignored what little they had ever known of the 
Guardians, and of  the labours of those that made possible the long peace of 
the  Shire. They were, in fact, sheltered, but they had ceased  to  remember  
it. 
     At no  time had Hobbits of any  kind been  warlike, and  they had never  

####-fought  among  themselves. In olden days  they had, of  course,  been  often 
obliged to fight to maintain themselves in a hard world; but in Bilbo's time 
that was very ancient history. The last battle, before this story opens, and 
indeed the  only  one  that had ever been  fought  within the borders of the 
Shire, was beyond  living memory: the Battle  of  Greenfields, S.R. 1147, in  
which Bandobras Took routed an invasion of Orcs. Even the weathers had 
grown 
milder, and the  wolves  that had once  come ravening  out of the  North  in 
bitter white winters were  now only  a grandfather's tale. So,  though there 
was still  some store of  weapons in the  Shire, these were  used  mostly as 
trophies, hanging above hearths or on  walls, or gathered into the museum at 
Michel Delving. The  Mathom-house it was  called; for  anything that Hobbits 
had  no immediate use for, but were unwilling to throw away,  they  called a  
mathom.  Their dwellings were apt to become rather crowded with mathoms, 
and 
many of the presents that passed from hand to hand were of that son. 
     Nonetheless, ease and peace had left this people still curiously tough. 
They were,  if it came to it, difficult to daunt or to kill; and they  were, 
perhaps,  so unwearyingly fond of  good things not least because they could, 
when put to it, do without them,  and could survive rough handling by grief,  
foe,  or weather in  a way that astonished those who did not know them  well 
and  looked  no further than their bellies and their well-fed  faces. Though 
slow to quarrel, and for sport killing nothing that lived, they were doughty 
at bay,  and  at  need could still handle arms. They shot well with the bow,  
for they were keen-eyed and sure at the mark. Not only with bows and arrows.  
If any Hobbit stooped for a stone,  it was well to get  quickly under cover, 
as all trespassing beasts knew very well. 
     All Hobbits had originally  lived in  holes in the  ground, or  so they 
believed,  and in such dwellings they still  felt most at  home; but  in  the 
course of time they had been obliged to adopt other forms of abode. Actually 
in  the Shire in Bilbo's  days it  was, as a rule, only the richest and  the 
poorest Hobbits  that maintained the old custom. The poorest  went on  living 
in burrows  of the  most  primitive  kind,  mere holes indeed, with only one 
window or  none;  while  the  well-to-do  still constructed  more  luxurious 
versions of the simple diggings of old.  But suitable  sites for these large 
and ramifying tunnels (or smials as they called them) were not everywhere to 
be found; and in the flats and the low-lying districts the Hobbits, as  they 

####-multiplied, began to  build above ground. Indeed, even in the hilly  regions 
and the older villages, such  as  Hobbiton or Tuckborough,  or in the  chief 
township of the Shire, Michel Delving  on  the White Downs, there  were  now 
many houses  of wood,  brick, or stone. These  were  specially  favoured  by 
millers, smiths, ropers,  and cartwrights, and others of that sort; for even 
when  they  had holes to live in. Hobbits had long been  accustomed to build 
sheds and workshops. 
     The habit of building farmhouses and barns was said to have begun among 
the inhabitants of the Marish  down by the Brandywine.  The  Hobbits of that 
quarter, the Eastfarthing, were rather large and heavy-legged, and they wore 
dwarf-boots in muddy  weather. But they were well known  to  be Stoors in  a 
large part of their blood, as indeed was shown by the down that many grew on 
their chins. No Har foot  or Fallohide had  any trace of a beard. Indeed, the 
folk  of  the Marish,  and  of Buckland,  east  of  the  River,  which  they 
afterwards  occupied, came for the most  part  later into the Shire  up from 
south-away;  and  they still had many peculiar names and strange  words  not 
found elsewhere in the Shire. 
     It is probable that the craft of building, as many other crafts beside, 
was derived from the D®nedain. But  the Hobbits  may  have learned it direct 
from the Elves, the teachers of  Men  in their  youth. For the Elves of  the 
High Kindred had not yet forsaken Middle-earth, and they dwelt still at that 
time at  the Grey Havens away to the west, and in other  places within reach 
of the  Shire. Three  Elf-towers of immemorial age were still to be seen  on 
the  Tower Hills  beyond the  western marches.  They shone far  off  in  the 
moonlight. The tallest was furthest away, standing alone upon a green mound. 
The Hobbits of the Westfarthing said that one could see the Sea from the lop  
of that tower; but  no  Hobbit had ever  been known to climb it. Indeed, few 
Hobbits  had ever  seen or  sailed  upon the Sea, and fewer  still had  ever  
returned to  report  it. Most Hobbits regarded even  rivers  and small boats 
with deep misgivings, and not  many of  them could swim.  And as the days of 
the Shire lengthened  they  spoke  less and  less with  the  Elves, and grew 
afraid  of them, and distrustful of those  that  had dealings with them; and 
the Sea  became  a word  of fear  among them, and a token of death, and they 
turned their faces away from the hills in the west. 
     The craft  of building may have come from Elves or Men, but the Hobbits 
used it in  their own fashion. They did not go in  for  towers. Their houses 
were usually long, low,  and comfortable. The oldest kind  were,  indeed, no 

####-more than built imitations of smials, thatched with dry  grass or  straw, or  
roofed with turves,  and having walls somewhat  bulged. That stage, however, 
belonged to the early days of the Shire, and hobbit-building had long  since 
been  altered, improved by devices,  learned from Dwarves,  or discovered by 
themselves.  A  preference for round windows, and even round  doors, was the 
chief remaining peculiarity of hobbit -architecture. 
     The houses  and  the  holes   of  Shire-hobbits  were  often  large, and 
inhabited by large families. (Bilbo and Frodo Baggins were as bachelors very 
exceptional,  as they were also in many other ways, such as their friendship 
with the Elves.) Sometimes, as in the case  of the Tooks of Great Smials, or  
the Brandybucks  of  Brandy Hall,  many  generations of  relatives  lived in 
(comparative) peace  together  in one ancestral  and many -tunnelled mansion. 
All Hobbits were, in any case,  clannish and reckoned up their relationships 
with great care. They drew long and elaborate family -trees with  innumerable 
branches. In dealing with Hobbits it is important to remember who is related 
to whom,  and in what degree. It would be impossible in this book to set out 
a  family-tree  that included  even the more  important members of the  more 
important families at  the  time which these tales tell of. The genealogical 
trees  at  the  end  of  the  Red Book of  Westmarch  are  a  small book  in 
themselves,  and all but Hobbits  would find them  exceedingly dull. Hobbits 
delighted in such things, if they  were accurate: they liked  to  have books 
filled with  things that they already knew, set out fair and  square with no 
contradictions.

2. Concerning Pipe-weed 

 
 
     There is another astonishing  thing about Hobbits of old  that must  be 
mentioned, an astonishing habit: they imbibed  or inhaled, through pipes  of 
clay or wood, the smoke of the burning leaves of  a herb, which they  called  
pipe-weed or leaf, a variety  probably of Nicotiana. A great deal of mystery 
surrounds the  origin  of this peculiar  custom,  or  'art' as  the  Hobbits 
preferred to call it. All that could be discovered about it in antiquity was 
put together by Meriadoc Brandybuck (later Master of Buckland), and since he 
and  the   tobacco  of the Southfarthing  play  a part in  the  history  that 
follows, his remarks in the introduction to his Herblore of the Shire may be 
quoted. 
     'This,'  he says, 'is the one art that we can certainly claim to be our 
own invention.  When  Hobbi ts  first began  to smoke  is not known,  all the  
legends and family histories take it for granted; for ages folk in the Shire 
smoked various herbs, some fouler, some sweeter. But all accounts agree that 
Tobold Hornblower  of  Longbottom  in the Southfarthing first grew  the true 
pipe-weed in his gardens in  the days of Isengrim the Second, about the year  
1070 of Shire-reckoning. The best home-grown still comes from that district, 
especially the  varieties  now  known  as Longbottom  Leaf,  Old  Toby,  and 
Southern Star. 
     'How Old  Toby came by  the plant is not recorded, for to his dying day 
he would not tell.  He knew much about herbs, but he was no traveller. It is 
said that in his youth he went often to Bree, though he certainly never went 
further fr om the Shire than that.  It is thus quite possible that he learned 
of this plant in Bree, where now, at  any rate,  it grows well on  the south 
slopes of the hill. The  Bree-hobbits  claim to have been the  first  actual 
smokers of the pipe-weed.  They cla im,  of  course, to have done  everything  
before the people of the Shire,  whom they refer  to as "colonists"; but  in 
this case their claim is, I think,  likely to be true. And  certainly it was 
from Bree  that the  art  of smoking  the genuine weed sprea d  in the recent 
centuries among Dwarves and such other folk, Rangers, Wizards, or wanderers,  
as still passed  to and fro through that  ancient road-meeting. The home and 
centre of  the an is thus to be found in  the old inn of  Bree, The Prancing 

####-Pony, that has been kept by the family of Butterbur from time beyond record. 
     'All the same,  observations  that I have made on my own many  journeys 
south have convinced me that the weed itself  is not  native to our parts of 
the  world,  but  came  northward  from the lower Anduin, whither  it was, I 
suspect, originally brought  over  Sea by the Men  of  Westernesse. It grows 
abundantly  in  Gondor, and  there  is richer and  larger than in the North, 
where it is never found wild, and flourishes  only in  warm sheltered places 
like Longbottom. The Men of Gondor call it sweet galenas, and esteem it only 
for the fragrance of its  flowers. From  that land it must have been carried 
up the Greenway  during the long centuries between the coming of Elendil and 
our own day.  But even the D®nedain of  Gondor allow us this credit: Hobbits 
first put it into pipes.  Not even the Wizards first thought of that  before 
we did.  Though one Wizard that I knew took up the art long ago,  and became 
as skilful in it as in all other things that he put his mind to.'

3. Of the Ordering of the Shire 

 
 
     The  Shire was  divided  into  four  quarters,  the  Farthings  already 
referred to.  North,  South, East,  and  West;  and  these again each into a  
number of folklands,  which still bore the names of some of  the old leading  
families, although by the time  of this  history these names were no  longer 
found only in their  proper folklands.  Nearly all Tooks  still lived in the 
Tookland,  but that  was not  true  of  many  other  families,  such  as the 
Bagginses  or  the Boffins.  Outside the  Farthings  were the  East and West 
Marches:  the  Buckland  (see  beginning of Chapter  V,  Book  I);  and  the 
Westmarch added to the Shire in S.R. 1462. 
     The Shire at  this time had hardly any 'government'. Families  for  the 
most part  managed their  own affairs. Growing  food and eating  it occupied  
most of their time. In  other matters they were, as a rule, generous and not 
greedy, but  contented and moderate, so  that estates, farms, workshops, and 
small trades tended to remain unchanged for generations.  
     There  remained,  of course, the  ancient tradition concerning the high 
king at  Fornost, or Norbury as they called it, away north of the Shire. But 
there had been no king for nearly  a thousand years,  and even the ruins  of 
Kings' Norbury  were covered with grass. Yet the Hobbits  still said of wild 
folk and wicked things (such as trolls) that they had not heard of the king. 
For they attributed to the king of old all their essential laws; and usually 
they kept the laws of free will, because they were The Rules (as they said), 
both ancient and just. 
     It is true  that  the Took  family had long  been  pre-eminent; for the 
office  of  Thain had  passed  to them  (from the Oldbucks)  some  centuries 
before,  and the chief  Took had borne that title ever since. The  Thain was 
the  master  of  the  Shire-moot, and captain of  the Shire-muster  and  the 
Hobbitry-in-arms,  but  as  muster  and moot  were only  held  in  times  of 
emergency,  which no  longer occurred, the Thainship  had  ceased to be more 
than  a  nominal dignity. The  Took  family was  still,  indeed,  accorded a  
special respect, for it remained  both numerous and exceedingly wealthy, and 
was  liable  to produce in ever y generation strong  characters  of  peculiar 
habits and even adventurous temperament. The latter qualities, however, were 

####-now  rather  tolerated (in  the  rich) than  generally  approved. The custom 
endured, nonetheless, of referring to the head of the  family  as The  Took, 
and of  adding  to  his  name, if  required, a number: such  as Isengrim the 
Second, for instance. 
     The only  real official  in the Shire  at  this date  was the Mayor  of 
Michel Delving (or of the Shire), who was  elected every  seven years at the 
Free Fair on the White  Downs at  the Lithe, that is at Midsummer.  As mayor  
almost   his  only  duty   was  to  preside   at  banquets,  given   on  the 
Shire-holidays,  which occurred at  frequent intervals. But  the  offices of 
Postmaster and First Shirriff were attached  to  the  mayoralty, so that  he 
managed  both the  Messenger Service  and  the  Watch.  These were the  only 
Shire-services,  and the Messengers  were the  most  numerous,  and much the 
busier of the two. By no means a ll Hobbits were lettered, but those who were 
wrote constantly to all their friends (and a  selection  of their relations)  
who lived further off than an afternoon's walk. 
     The Shirriffs was the name  that the  Hobbits gave to  their police, or  
the nearest equivalent that they possessed. They had, of course, no uniforms 
(such things being  quite unknown), only  a feather in their caps;  and they 
were  in  practice rather haywards than policemen,  more concerned  with the 
strayings of  beasts than of people. There were in all the Shire only twelve 
of them, three in  each  Farthing,  for  Inside Work. A  rather larger body, 
varying  at need,  was  employed  to  'beat  the  bounds', and to  see  that 
Outsiders of any kind, great or small, did not make themselves a nuisance. 
     At the time  when this story begins the Bounders, as they were  called, 
had been greatly  increased.  There  were  many reports  and  complaints  of 
strange persons  and creatures prowling about the borders, or over them: the 
first  sign  that all  was not  quite as  it  should be, and always had been 
except  in tales and legends of  long ago. Few heeded the sign, and not even  
Bilbo yet had any notion of what it portended. Sixty years  had passed since 
he set out on his  memorable journey, and he was old  even for Hobbits,  who 
reached a hundred  as often as not; but much evidently still remained of the 
considerable  wealth that he  had brought back. How  much or  how  little he 
revealed to no one,  not even to Frodo  his favourite 'nephew'. And he still 
kept secret the ring that he bad found. 

####- 

4. Of the Finding of the Ring  

 
 
     As is  told in The Hobbit, there came one day to Bilbo's door the great 
Wizard, Gandalf the Grey, and thirteen dwarves with him: none other, indeed, 
than Thorin Oakenshield,  descendant  of kings, and his twelve companions in 
exile. With  them he set  out, to his own lasting astonishment, on a morning 
of  April, it being then  the year 1341 Shire-reckoning, on a quest of great 
treasure, the dwarf-hoards of the Kings under the Mountain,  beneath  Erebor 
in Dale, far off in the East. The quest was  successful, and the Dragon that 
guarded the hoard was destroyed. Yet, though before  all  was won the Battle 
of Five Armies was fought, and Thorin was slain, and  many deeds  of  renown 
were done, the matter would scarcely have concerned later history, or earned 
more than a note in the long annals of the Third Age, but for an  'accident' 
by the way.  The  party was assailed by  Orcs in a  high pass  of  the Misty 
Mountains as they went towards Wilderland; and so it happened that Bilbo was 
lost for a while in the black orc-mines deep under the mountains, and there, 
as he groped  in vain in the dark, he put  his hand on  a ring, lying on the 
floor of a tunnel. He put it in h is pocket. It seemed then like mere luck. 
     Trying to find  his way out. Bilbo went on  down to  the  roots  of the 
mountains, until he could go no further.  At the bottom  of the tunnel lay a  
cold lake far  from the light, and on an island  of rock  in the water lived 
Gollum. He was a loathsome little creature: he paddled a small boat with his 
large  flat feet,  peering with pale luminous eyes  and  catching blind fish 
with his long fingers, and eating  them raw.  He ate  any living thing, even 
orc, if  he could catch it and strangle it without a struggle. He possessed a  
secret treasure that had come to him long ages ago,  when he  still lived in 
the light: a ring  of gold  that made its  wearer invisible. It was the  one 
thing he  loved, his 'precious', and he talked to  it, even when it  was not 
with him. For he kept it hidden safe in a hole on his island, except when he 
was hunting or spying on the ores of the mines. 
     Maybe he would have attacked Bilbo at once, if the ring had been on him 
when they met;  but it was  not, and  the hobbit held  in his hand an Elvish 
knife,  which served him as a sword. So to gain time Gollum challenged Bilbo 
to the Riddle-game,  saying that if he  asked a riddle which Bilbo could not 

####-guess, then  he would kill him and eat him;  but if Bilbo defeated him, then 
he would do as Bilbo wished: he would lead him to a way out of the tunnels.  
     Since he was lost in the dark without hope, and could neither go on nor  
back. Bilbo accepted the challenge; and they asked one another many riddles.  
In the end Bilbo won the game, more by luck (as it seemed) than by wits; for 
he was stumped at last  for a riddle to ask, and cried out, as his hand came 
upon the ring he lad picked up and forgotten:  What  haw I got in my pocket? 
This Gollum failed to answer, though he demanded three guesses. 
     The  Authorities, it is true, differ whether  this last  question was a  
mere  'question' and not  a  'riddle' according to  the strict rules  of the 
Game; but all agree that, after accepting it and trying to guess the answer, 
Gollum was bound by his promise. And Bilbo pressed him to keep his word; 
for 
the  thought  came  to him that  this slimy creature might prove false, even 
though  such  promises  were held sacred, and of old all  but  the wickedest 
things feared to break them. But after ages alone in the dark Gollum's heart 
was black, and  treachery was in it.  He slipped  away, and  returned to the 
island, of which Bilbo knew nothing,  not far off in the dark  water. There, 
he  thought,  lay  his  ring.  He was hungry now,  and angry, and  once  his 
'precious' was with him he would not fear any weapon at all. 
     But the ring was  not on the island; he had  lost it, it was  gone. His 
screech  sent a shiver down Bilbo's back, though he  did not  yet understand 
what  had happened. But Gollum had at last leaped to a guess, too late. What 
has  it got  in its pocketses? he  cried. The light in his eyes  was like  a  
green flame as he sped back to murder the hobbit and recover his 'precious'.  
Just  in  time Bilbo saw his peril,  and he fled blindly up the passage away 
from the water;  and once more he was saved by his luck. For  just as he ran 
he  put  his  hand in his  pocket, and  the ring  slipped  quietly on to his 
finger. So it was that  Gollum passed him  without seeing him, and  went  to  
guard  the  way out, lest the 'thief' should escape.  Warily Bilbo  followed 
him, as he went along, cursing, and talking to himself about his 'precious';  
from which  talk at last even Bilbo guessed the truth,  and hope came to him 
in the darkness: he himself had  found the marvellous  ring and a chance  of 
escape from the orcs and from Gollum. 
     At length they  came to a halt before an unseen opening that led to the 
lower  gates  of  the mines,  on the eastward  side of the mountains.  There 
Gollum  crouched at bay, smelling and listening;  and Bilbo  was  tempted to 

####-slay him with his sword. But  pity stayed him, and though  he kept the ring, 
in  which  his  only hope lay, he  would not  use  it  to  help him kill the 
wretched creature at a disadvantage. In  the  end, gathering his courage, he 
leaped  over  Gollum in the dark, and fled away down the passage, pursued by 
his enemy's cries  of hate and despair: Thief,  thief! Baggins!  We hates it 
for ever! 
     Now it is a curious fact that this is not the story as Bilbo first told 
it to his companions.  To  them his account was  that Gollum had promised to 
give  him a present, if he  won the game;  but when  Gollum went to fetch it  
from his island he found the treasure was gone: a magic ring, which had been 
given to him long ago on his birthday. Bilbo guessed that this was the  very 
ring  that he  had found, and as he had won the game, it was already  his by 
right. But being in a tight place, he said nothing about it, and made Gollum 
show him  the way out, as a reward instead of  a present. This account Bilbo 
set down in  his memoirs, and he seems never to have altered it himself, not  
even after  the  Council of  Elrond.  Evidently  it  still  appeared in  the 
origina l Red Book, as it  did  in several of the  copies  and abstracts. But 
many copies contain the  true account (as an alternative), derived no  doubt 
from notes by Frodo  or Samwise, both of whom learned the truth, though they 
seem to have been unwilling to delete anything  actually written by the  old 
hobbit himself. 
     Gandalf, however,  disbelieved Bilbo's first story, as soon as he heard 
it,  and he continued  to be very curious about the ring. Eventually he  got 
the true  tale  out  of  Bilbo  after much questioning,  which for  a  while 
strained  their  friendship;  but  the  wizard seemed  to  think  the  truth 
important. Though he did not say so to Bilbo, he also thought  it important, 
and disturbing, to find that the good hobbit had not told the truth from the 
first:  quite contrary to his  habit. The idea of a 'present' was  not  mere 
hobbitlike  invention,  all the  same.  It was  suggested  to Bilbo,  as  he 
confessed, by Gollum's talk that he overheard; for Gollum did, in fact, call 
the  ring  his 'birthday  present', many times.  That also  Gandalf  thought 
strange and suspicious; but he did not discover the truth in  this point for  
many more years, as will be seen in this book. 
     Of  Bilbo's  later adventures little  more need be said here. Wi th  the 
help of the ring he escaped from the orc-guards at the gate and rejoined his 
companions. He  used the ring many times on his  quest, chiefly for the help 
of his  friends; but  he kept it secret from them as long as he could. After  

####-his return to his home he never spoke  of  it  again to anyone, save Gandalf 
and Frodo;  and no one else  in the  Shire knew of its  existence,  or so he 
believed. Only to Frodo did he show  the account of  his Journey that he was 
writing. 
     His  sword,  Sting, Bilbo hu ng  over his  fireplace,  and  his coat  of 
marvellous mail, the gift of the Dwarves from the Dragon-hoard, he lent to a  
museum, to the Michel Delving Mathom-house in fact. But he kept in a  drawer  
at Bag  End  the old cloak and hood that he had worn on his travels; and the  
ring, secured by a fine chain, remained in his pocket. 
     He returned to his home at Bag End on June the 22nd in his fifty-second 
year (S.R. 1342),  and nothing very notable occurred in the  Shire until Mr. 
Baggins    began    the   pr eparations   for   the   celebration   of    his 
hundred-and-eleventh birthday  (S.R.  1401).  At  this  point  this  History 
begins.

NOTE ON THE SHIRE RECORDS 

 
 
     At the end of the Third Age the part played by the Hobbits in the great 
events that led  to  the  inclusion  of  the Shire  in the  Reunited Kingdom 
awakened among them a  more widespread  interest in  their own  history; and 
many of their traditions, up to that time still  mainly oral, were collected 
and Written down. The  greater families were  also concerned with  events in 
the  Kingdom  at  large,  and  many  of  their members  studied its  ancient 
histories and  legends. By the  end of the  first century of the Fourth  Age 
there were already to be found in the Shire several libraries tha t contained 
many historical books and records. 
     The largest of these collections were probably at Undertowers, at Great 
Smials,  and at Brandy Hall.  This  account of the end of  the Third  Age is 
drawn mainly from the Red Book of Westmarch. That most important  source 
for 
the  history  of  the War  of  the Ring was so  called because it  was  long 
preserved  at  Undertowers,  the  home  of the Fairbairns,  Wardens  of  the 
Westmarch.1  It was in origin Bilbo's private diary, which he took with  him 
to Rivendell.  Frodo brought  it back to the Shire, together with many loose 
leaves of notes, and during S.R. 1420-1 he nearly filled its pages  with his 
account of the War.  But annexed to  it  and preserved with it, probably m a  
single red case, were  the three large  volumes, bound in  red leather, that 
Bilbo gave  to him as a parting gift. To these four  volumes there was added  
in Westmarch a fifth containing commentaries, genealogies, and various other  
matter concerning the hobbit members of the Fellowship. 
     The original Red Book has  not been  preserved, but  many  copies  were 
made,  especially of the first volume, for the use of the descendants of the 
children  of  Master  Samwise.  The  most  important  copy, however,  has  a  
different history.  It  was kept at  Great  Smials,  but it  was written  in 
Condor,  probably at  the  request  of the  great-grandson  of Peregrin, and 
completed in S.R. 1592  (F.A. 172). Its southern scribe appended this  note: 
Findegil,  King's Writer, finished this work in IV 172. It  is an exact copy 
in  all details of the Thain's Book  m Minas Tirith.  That book was  a copy, 
made at the request of King Elessar,  of the Red Book of the Periannath, and 

####-was brought to him by the Thain Peregrin when he retired to Gondor in IV 64 . 
     The Thain's Book was  thus  the first copy made of  the  Red  Book  and 
contained much that was later omitted or lost.  In Minas  Tirith it received 
much  annotation, and  many  corrections, especially  of  names,  words, and 
quotations in the Elvish languages; and there was added to it an abbreviated  
version of those  parts of The  Tale of Aragorn  and Arwen which lie outside 
the  account of the War. The full tale  is  stated  to have been written  by 
Barahir, grandson of the Steward Faramir, some time after the passing of the  
King. But the chief importance of  Findegil's copy is that it alone contains 
the whole  of Bilbo's 'Translations from the  Elvish'. These  three  volumes 
were  found to be a work of great skill and learning in  which, between 1403 
and 1418, he had used all the sources  available to  him  in Rivendell, both 
living and written. But  since they were little used by Frodo, being  almost  
entirely concerned with the Elder Days, no more is said of them here. 
     Since Meriadoc and Peregrin became the  heads  of their great families,  
and  at the  same time kept up their  connexions with Rohan and  Gondor, the 
libraries at Bucklebury and Tuckborough contained much that did  not  appear 
in the Red Book.  In Brandy Hall there were many works dealing  with Eriador  
and the  history of Rohan. Some of these were composed or  begun by 
Meriadoc 
himself, though in the  Shire he was chiefly remembered for  his Herblore of 
the Shire, and for his Reckoning of  Years m which he discussed the relation 
of the calendars of the Shire and Bree  to those of  Rivendell,  Gondor, and 
Rohan. He also wrote a short treatise on Old Words and Names  in the  Shire, 
having special interest  in discovering the kinship with the language of the 
Rohirrim of such 'shire-words' as mathom and old elements in place names. 
     At Great Smials the books were  of less interest to Shire-folk,  though 
more important for larger history. None of them was written by Peregrin, but 
he and  his successors  collected  many manuscripts written  by  scribes  of 
Gondor:  mainly  copies  or  summaries of  histories or legends  relating to 
Elendil  and his heirs. Only  here in the Shire were to  be  found extensive 
materials for  the history  of  N®menor and the  arising of  Sauron.  It was 
probably at Great Smials that The Tale of Years1 was put  together, with the 
assistance of material  collected by Meriadoc. Though  the dates  given  are 
often conjectural, especially for the Second Age, they deserve attention. It 
is   probable  that  Mer iadoc  obtained   assistance  and  information  from 
Rivendell,  which he  visited  more  than  once.  There, though  Elrond  had 

####-departed, his sons long remained, together with some of the High-elven folk. 
It  is  said  that  Celeborn  went  to  dwell  there after the departure  of 
Galadriel; but there is no record of the day when at last he sought the Grey 
Havens,  and  with  him went the last  living  memory  of the  Elder Days in  
Middle-earth.

Chapter 1. A Long-expected Party 

 
 
     When  Mr. Bilbo Baggins of Bag  End announced that  he would shortly be 
celebrating   his   eleventy-first  birthday   with  a   party  of   special 
magnificence, there was much talk and excitement in Hobbiton. 
     Bilbo  was very rich  and very peculiar, and had been the wonder of the 
Shire  for  sixty   years,  ever  since  his  remarkable  disappearance  and 
unexpected return. The riches  he  had brought back from his travels had now 
become  a local legend, and it was popularly believed, whatever the old folk  
might  say,  that  the Hill  at Bag  End was  full  of tunnels  stuffed with 
treasure. And if that was not enough for  fame, there was also his prolonged  
vigour  to marvel at. Time wore on,  but it seemed to  have little effect on 
Mr. Baggins. At ninety he was much the same as at fifty. At ninety-nine they 
began to  call him well-preserved,  but unchanged would have been nearer the 
mark. There were  some that shook their heads and thought  this was too much 
of  a good thing; it seemed unfair that anyone should  possess  (apparently)  
perpetual youth as well as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth. 
     'It  will  have  to be  paid for,'  they said. 'It  isn't natural,  and 
trouble will come of it!' 
     But so far trouble had not come;  and as Mr. Baggins was  generous with 
his money, most people were willing to forgive him his oddities and his good 
fortune.  He  remained  on visiting  terms with  his  relatives (except,  of 
course, the Sackville-Bagginses), and he had many devoted admirers among 
the 
hobbits of poor and unimportant families. But he had no close friends, until 
some of his younger cousins began to grow up. 
     The eldest of  these,  and Bilbo's favourite,  was young Frodo Baggins. 
When Bilbo was ninety-nine, he adopted Frodo as his heir, and brought him to 
live  at Bag End;  and the  hopes  of the  Sackville-Bagginses were  finally 
dashed. Bilbo and Frodo happened to have the same  birthday, September 
22nd. 
'You had better come and live here, Frodo my lad,' said  Bilbo one day; 'and 
then we  can  celebrate our birthday-parties  comfortably together.' At that 

####-time Frodo  was still in his tweens, as the hobbits called the irresponsible 
twenties between childhood and coming of age at thirty-three. 
     Twelve more years passed. Each year the Bagginses  had given very lively 
combined  birthday-parties  at  Bag  End;  but  now  it  was understood that 
something  quite  exceptional was being planned  for that autumn.  Bilbo was 
going  to  be  eleventy -one,  111,  a  rather  curious  number  and  a  very 
respectable  age  for a hobbit (the Old Took  himself had only reached 130); 
and Frodo was going to be thirty- three, 33) an important number: the date of 
his 'coming of age'.  
     Tongues began to wag in  Hobbiton and Bywater; and rumour of the coming 
event travelled all  over the Shire. The  history and character of Mr. Bilbo 
Baggins became once again the  chief  topic of  conversation; and the  older  
folk suddenly found their reminiscences in welcome demand. 
     No one  had  a  more attentive audience than old Ham  Gamgee,  commonly 
known as  the  Gaffer. He held forth  at  The Ivy Bush,  a small inn on  the 
Bywater road; and he spoke with some authority, for he had tended the garden 
at Bag End for forty years, and had helped old Holman in the same job befor e 
that. Now that he was himself  growing old  and stiff in the joints, the job 
was mainly  carried on by his youngest son, Sam Gamgee. Both father  and son 
were on very friendly  terms with Bilbo and  Frodo. They  lived  on the Hill  
itself, in Number 3 Bagshot Row just below Bag End. 
     'A very nice  well-spoken  gentlehobbit  is  Mr.  Bilbo, as I've always 
said,' the Gaffer declared. With perfect truth: for Bilbo was very polite to 
him, calling him 'Master Hamfast', and consulting  him  constantly upon  the 
growing  of vegetables  - in the matter of 'roots', especially  potatoes, the 
Gaffer was recognized as the  leading authority  by all in the neighbourhood 
(including himself). 
     'But  what about this Frodo that lives with  him?'  asked Old Noakes of 
Bywater.  'Baggins is his name, but he's more than  half a  Brandybuck, they 
say. It beats me why any Baggins  of  Hobbiton should go looking for a  wife 
away there in Buckland, where folks are so queer.' 
     'And no  wonder they're queer,'  put  in  Daddy  Twofoot  (the Gaffer's 
next-door neighbour),  'if they live  on  the wrong  side of the  Brandywine 
River, and right agin  the Old Forest. That's a dark bad place, if half  the 
tales be true.' 
     'You're right,  Dad!' said  the  Gaffer. 'Not  that  the Brandybucks of 
Buck-land live in the Old Forest; but they're a queer breed, seemingly. They  

####-fool about  with boats on that big  river   - and that  isn't  natural. Small 
wonder that trouble came of  it,  I say. But be that as it may, Mr. Frodo is 
as nice a young hobbit  as you could wish to meet. Very much like Mr. Bilbo, 
and in  more than  looks.  After all his  father  was  a Baggins.  A  decent 
respectable hobbit was Mr. Drogo  Baggins; there  was never much to tell  of 
him, till he was drownded.' 
     'Drownded?' said several  voices. They  had heard this and other darker  
rumours before, of course; but  hobbits have a passion  for  family history, 
and they were ready to hear  it again. 'Well, so they say,' said the Gaffer. 
'You see: Mr. Drogo, he married poor Miss  Primula Brandybuck.  She  was 
our 
Mr. Bilbo's first cousin on the mother's side (her mother being the youngest 
of the Old Took's  daughters); and Mr.  Drogo  was his second cousin. So Mr. 
Frodo is his first and second cousin, once removed either way, as the saying 
is,  if  you  follow me.  And Mr. Drogo was  staying at Brandy Hall with his 
father -in-law, old Master Gorbadoc, as he often  did after his marriage (him 
being partial to  his vittles,  and old  Gorbadoc keeping  a mighty generous 
table); and he went out boating on the Brandywine River; and he and his wife 
were drownded, and poor Mr. Frodo only a child and all. ' 
     'I've heard they went on the water after dinner in the moonlight,' said 
Old Noakes; 'and it was Drogo's weight as sunk the boat.' 
     'And I heard she pushed him in, and  he pulled her in after him,'  said 
Sandyman, the Hobbiton miller. 
     'You shouldn't listen  to all you hear, Sandyman,' said the Gaffer, who 
did not much like the miller. 'There isn't no  call to go ta lking of pushing 
and pulling. Boats are quite tricky enough for those that sit  still without 
looking  further for the cause of trouble. Anyway: there was this  Mr. Frodo  
left  an  orphan  and  stranded,  as  you  might   say,  among  those  queer  
Bucklanders,  being brought  up anyhow  in Brandy Hall. A regular warren, by 
all accounts. Old Master Gorbadoc never had fewer than  a couple  of hundred 
relations in  the place.  Mr. Bilbo  never did  a kinder  deed  than when he 
brought the lad back to live among decent folk. 
     'But I  reckon it was a nasty shock for those Sackville-Bagginses. They  
thought  they were going to get Bag End,  that time when he went off and was 
thought to be dead.  And then he comes back and orders them off; and he goes 
on living and living, and never looking a day older, bless him! And suddenly 
he  produces  an  heir,  and  has  all  the  papers  made  out  proper.  The 

####-Sackville-Bagginses won't never  see the inside of Bag End now, or it  is to 
be hoped not.' 
     'There's a tidy bit of money tucked away up there, I hear tell,' said a  
stranger,  a visitor on  business from  Michel Delving in the  Westfarthing. 
'All the top of  your hill is full of tunnels packed with chests of gold and 
silver, and jools, by what I've heard. ' 
     'Then you've heard  more than I  can speak  to,' answered the Gaffer. I 
know nothing about  jools.  Mr. Bilbo is free with  his money, and there seems 
no lack of it; but I know of no tunnel -making. I  saw Mr. Bilbo when he came 
back, a matter of  sixty  years  ago,  when I was a  lad. I'd  not long come 
prentice to old  Holman (him being my dad's cousin), but he had me up at Bag 
End helping  him  to keep folks from trampling and  trapessing  all over the 
garden while the sale was on. And in the middle of it all Mr. Bilbo comes up 
the Hill  with  a pony and some mighty big  bags and a couple  of  chests. I 
don't  doubt  they were mostly full of treasure  he had picked up in foreign 
parts, where there be mountains of gold, they  say;  but there wasn't enough 
to fill tunnels. But  my lad Sam will know  more about that. He's in and out 
of Bag End. Crazy about stories of the old days he is, and he listens to all 
Mr. Bilbo's  tales. Mr. Bilbo has learned him his letters  - meaning no harm, 
mark you, and I hope no harm will come of it. 
     'Elves and Dragons' I says  to him. 'Cabbages and  potatoes are  better 
for me and  you. Don't go getting mixed up in  the business of your betters, 
or you'll land in trouble  too big for you,' I says  to him. And I might say 
it to others,' he added with a look at the stranger and the miller. 
     But the Gaffer did  not convince  his audience. The  legend  of Bilbo's 
wealth was now too  firmly fixed in the minds  of the  younger generation of  
hobbits. 
     'Ah, but he has likely enough been adding to what he brought at first,' 
argued the miller, voicing common  opinion. 'He's often  away from home. And 
look at the outlandish  folk that visit him:  dwarves  coming at night,  and 
that old wandering conjuror, Gandalf,  and  all. You can say  what you like, 
Gaffer, but Bag End's a queer place, and its folk are queerer.' 
     'And you can say what you like, about what you know no more of than you  
do of boating, Mr. Sandyman,' retorted the Gaffer, disliking the miller even 
more  than usual. If  that's being queer, then we could do  with a bit  more 
queerness in these parts. There's  some  not  far away that wouldn't offer a  
pint of beer to a friend, if they  lived  in  a hole with golden  walls. But 

####-they do things proper at Bag End. Our  Sam says that  everyone's going to be 
invited to the party, and there's  going to be presents, mark you,  presents 
for all - this very month as is.' 
     That very month  was  September, and as fine as you could ask. A day or  
two  later a rumour (probably  started by the knowledgeable Sam)  was spread 
about  that there were going to be fireworks  - fireworks, what is more, such 
as had not been seen in the Shire for nigh  on a  century, not indeed  since 
the Old Took died. 
     Days passed  and The Day drew nearer.  An odd-looking waggon laden with 
odd-looking packages rolled into Hobbiton one evening and toiled up the Hill 
to  Bag End. The startled hobbits peered out of lamplit doors to gape at it. 
It was driven  by outlandish  folk, singing strange songs: dwarves with long 
beards and deep hoods. A few of them remained at Bag End.  At the end of the 
second week in September a cart came in  through Bywater from the  direction 
of the  Brandywine Bridge in  broad daylight. An old  man was driving it all  
alone.  He  wore a tall pointed blue hat,  a  long grey cloak,  and a silver  
scarf. He  had a long white beard and bushy eyebrows  that stuck  out beyond 
the  brim of  his  hat. Small hobbit-children ran after the cart all through 
Hobbiton and right up the hill. It ha d a cargo of fireworks, as they rightly 
guessed. At Bilbo's front door the old man began to unload: there were great 
bundles of fireworks of all sorts and shapes, each labelled with a large red 
G and the elf-rune, . 
     That was Gandalf's mark, of course,  and the  old man  was Gandalf  the 
Wizard,  whose  fame in the Shire  was  due mainly to  his skill with fires,  
smokes, and lights.  His real business was far more difficult and dangerous, 
but  the Shire-folk knew nothing about  it. To them  he was just one  of the 
'attractions'  at the Party. Hence the excitement of the hobbit-children.  'G  
for Grand!' they  shouted, and the old man smiled.  They knew him by  sight, 
though he only appeared in Hobbiton occasionally and never stopped long; but 
neither they nor  any  but  the  oldest of  their elders had seen one of his 
firework displays  - they now belonged to the legendary past. 
     When the old  man,  helped by  Bilbo  and  some  dwarves,  had finished  
unloading. Bilbo gave a few pennies away; but not a single squib or  cracker  
was forthcoming, to the disappointment of the onlookers.  
     'Run  away now!' said  Gandalf.  'You  will  get plenty  when  the time 
comes.' Then he disappeared inside with Bilbo, and the door  was  shut.  The 
young  hobbits  stared at  the door  in vain for a while, and then made off, 

####-feeling that the day of the party would never come. 
     Inside Bag End, Bilbo and Gandalf were sitting at the open window  of a  
small room looking out west on to the garden.  The late afternoon was br ight  
and   peaceful.  The  flowers  glowed   red  and  golden:  snap-dragons  and 
sun-flowers, and nasturtiums trailing all over the turf walls and peeping in 
at the round windows.  
     'How bright your garden looks!' said Gandalf. 
     'Yes,' said Bilbo. I am very fond indeed of it, and of all the dear old 
Shire; but I think I need a holiday.' 
     'You mean to go on with your plan then?' 
     'I do. I made up my mind months ago, and I haven't changed it.' 
     'Very  well.  It is no good saying any  more.  Stick to your plan  - your 
whole plan, mind  - and I hope it will turn out for the best, for  you,  and 
for all of us.' 
     'I hope  so.  Anyway  I mean to enjoy  myself on Thursday, and  have my 
little joke.' 
     'Who will laugh, I wonder?' said Gandalf, shaking his head. 
     'We shall see,' said Bilbo. 
     The next day more carts rolled up the Hill, and still more carts. There 
might have  been  some grumbling about 'dealing locally', but that very week 
orders began to pour out of Bag End for every  kind of provision, commodity, 
or luxury  that  could be obtained in Hobbiton or Bywater or anywhere in the 
neighbourhood.  People  became enthusiastic; and they began to tick off  the 
days on  the calendar; and they watched eagerly for the  postman, hoping for  
invitations.  
     Before long  the  invitations  began  pouring  out,  and  the  Hobbiton 
post-office  was blocked, and the Bywater post -office  was snowed under, and 
voluntary assistant postmen were called for.  There was a constant stream of 
them going up the Hill, carrying hundreds of polite variations on Thank you, 
I shall certainly come. 
     A notice appeared on the gate at Bag End: NO ADMITTANCE EXCEPT 
ON PARTY 
BUSINESS. Even those  who had, or  pretended  to  have  Party  Business were 
seldom allowed inside. Bilbo  was  busy:  writing invitations,  ticking  off 
answers, packing up presents, and making  some  private preparations  of his 
own. From the time of Gandalf's arrival he remained hidden from view.  
     One morning the hobbits woke to find  the large field,  south of Bilbo's 

####-front door, covered with ropes and poles for tents  and pavilions. A special 
entrance  was cut into the bank leading to  the road, and wide steps  and  a  
large white gate were built there. The three hobbit-families of Bagshot Row,  
adjoining the field, were intensely  interested  and  generally envied.  Old 
Gaffer Gamgee stopped even pretending to work in his garden. 
     The tents began to  go up. There was a specially large pavilion, so big 
that the tree that grew in the   field was right inside it, and stood proudly 
near one end, at the head of  the chief table. Lanterns were hung on all its 
branches. More  promising still (to the hobbits' mind): an enormous open-air  
kitchen was erected in the  north corner of  the field. A draught  of cooks, 
from every inn and eating-house  for miles around, arrived to supplement the 
dwarves and other odd  folk  that were quartered at Bag End. Excitement rose 
to its height. 
     Then the weather  clouded  over.  That was on Wednesday the  eve of the  
Party.  Anxiety was  intense. Then Thursday,  September  the 22nd,  actually 
dawned. The sun got up, the clouds vanished, flags were unfurled and the fun 
began. 
     Bilbo  Baggins called it  a  party,  but it  was really  a  variety  of 
entertainments  rolled  into one.  Practically  everybody  living  near  was 
invited. A very few were overlooked  by accident, but  as they turned up all 
the same, that did not matter.  Many people  from other parts of  the  Shire 
were also asked; and there were even  a few from outside the  borders. Bilbo  
met the guests (and additions) at the new white gate in person. He gave away 
presents to all and sundry - the latter were  those  who went out again by a  
back way  and came  in  again by  the gate. Hobbits give   presents  to other  
people  on their own birthdays. Not very expensive ones, as a  rule, and not 
so lavishly  as on this  occasion; but it was  not a bad system. Actually in 
Hobbiton  and Bywater every  day in the year it was somebody's  birthday, so 
that every  hobbit  in those parts had a fair chance of at least one present 
at least once a week. But they never got tired of them. 
     On this occasion the presents were unusually  good. The hobbit-children 
were so excited that for a while they almost forgot  about eating. There were 
toys the like  of which they had  never seen before, all beautiful and  some 
obviously magical.  Many of them had indeed been ordered a year before,  and 
had  come  all  the way  from  the Mountain and from Dale, and  were of real 
dwarf-make. 
     When  every guest had been  welcomed  and was finally inside the  gate,  

####-there were  songs, dances, music, games,  and,  of course,  food  and drink. 
There were  three  official  meals: lunch,  tea, and dinner (or supper). But 
lunch and  tea were marked chiefly by  the fact that at  those times all the 
guests  were sitting  down and eating together. At  other  times  there were 
merely lots  of  people  eating and drinking  -  continuously from elevenses 
until six-thirty, when the fireworks  started. 
     The fireworks were by Gandalf: they were not only brought  by  him, but 
designed and made by  him; and the  special effects, set pieces, and flights 
of rockets were let off by him. But  there was  also a generous distribution 
of  squibs,  crackers,  backarappers,   sparklers,  torches,  dwarf-candles,  
elf-fountains, goblin-barkers  and thunder -claps. They  were all superb. The 
art of Gandalf improved with age. 
     There were  rockets like  a flight  of scintillating birds singing with 
sweet voices. There were green trees with trunks of dark smoke: their leaves  
opened like a whole spring unfolding in a moment, and their shining branches 
dropped glowing flowers down upon the  astonished hobbits, disappearing with 
a  sweet  scent just  before they touched  their  upturned faces. There were 
fountains  of butterflies that flew  glittering into  the trees;  there were 
pillars  of  coloured  fires that rose  and  turned into eagles, or  sailing 
ships,  or  a  phalanx of flying swans; there was a red  thunderstorm  and a  
shower  of  yellow  rain; there was a  forest  of silver spears  that sprang 
suddenly  into the  air with a  yell like an embattled  army, and came  down 
again into the Water with a hiss like a  hundred hot snakes.  And there  was 
also one last surprise,  in  honour of Bilbo,  and  it startled  the hobbits 
exceedingly, as  Gandalf intended. The lights went out. A great  smoke  went 
up. It shaped itself like a mountain seen in the distance, and began to glow 
at  the summit. It spouted green  and scarlet flames. Out flew a  red-golden 
dragon - not life-size, but terribly life-like: fire came from his jaws, his 
eyes glared down; there  was  a  roar, and he whizzed three  times  over the 
heads of the crowd. They all ducked, and  many fell fla t on their faces. The 
dragon passed like an  express train,  turned a  somersault, and  burst over  
Bywater with a deafening explosion. 
     'That is  the  signal for  supper!'  said  Bilbo.  The  pain  and alarm 
vanished at once, and the prostrate hobbits  leaped to their feet. There  was 
a splendid supper for everyone; for everyone, that  is, except those invited 
to the special family dinner -party. This was held in the great pavilion with 
the tree. The invitations were limited to twelve dozen (a number also called 

####-by the hobbits one Gross, though  the  word was not considered proper to use 
of people); and  the  guests were selected  from  all  the families to which 
Bilbo and Frodo were related, with  the addition of a  few special unrelated 
friends (such as Gandalf). Many young hobbits  were included, and present by 
parental permission; for hobbits were easy-going with their children in  the 
matter  of  sitting up late,  especially when there  was a chance of getting 
them a free meal. Bringing up young hobbits took a lot of provender. 
     There  were  many  Bagginses  and  Boffins,  and also  many  Tooks  and 
Brandybucks;  there  were  various  Grubbs   (relations  of  Bilbo  Baggins' 
grandmother), and various Chubbs (connexions of his Took grandfather); and a 
selection  of  Burrowses,  Bolgers, Bracegirdles,  Brockhouses,  Goodbodies, 
Hornblowers and Proudfoots. Some of these were only very distantly 
connected 
with Bilbo, and  some of them  had hardly ever  been in Hobbiton before,  as 
they lived in remote corners of the Shire. The Sackville-Bagginses  were not 
forgotten.  Otho and his wife Lobelia were present. They disliked Bilbo  and 
detested Frodo,  but  so magnificent  was the invitation  card,  written  in 
golden ink, that  they had felt it was impossible to refuse. Besides,  their 
cousin, Bilbo, had been specializing  in  food for many years and  his table 
had a high reputation. 
     All  the  one hundred  and forty-four guests expected a pleasant feast; 
though they  rather  dreaded  the  after -dinner  speech  of their  host  (an 
inevitable item). He was liable to drag  in bits of  what he  called poetry; 
and sometimes, after  a glass or two, would  allude to the absurd adventures 
of his mysterious journey. The guests were not disappointed: they had a very 
pleasant feast, in fact an engrossing entertainment: rich, abundant, varied, 
and prolonged. The  purchase of provisions fell almost to nothing throughout 
the district in the ensuing weeks; but as Bilbo's catering had  depleted the 
stocks of most stores, cellars and warehouses for miles around, that did not 
matter much. 
     After  the feast (more or less) came the  Speech. Most of  the  company 
were, however, now in a tolerant  mood, at that  delightful stage which they 
called 'filling up  the corners'.  They were sipping their favourite drinks,  
and nibbling at  their favourite  dainties, and their fears  were forgotten. 
They were prepared to listen to anything, and to cheer at every full stop. 
     My dear People, began Bilbo, rising in  his  place. 'Hear! Hear! Hear!' 
they shouted,  and  kept on repeating  it  in chorus,  seeming  reluctant to 

####-follow their own advice. Bilbo left  his place and went and stood on a chair 
under the illuminated  tree. The  light of the lanterns fell on his  beaming 
face; the golden buttons shone on his embroidered silk waistcoat. They could 
all see  him standing,  waving  one hand in  the air,  the other  was in his 
trouser-pocket. 
     My dear Bagginses and Boffins, he began again;  and my  dear  Tooks and 
Brandybucks, and Grubbs,  and  Chubbs,  and Burrowses,  and Hornblowers, 
and 
Bolgers, Bracegirdles, Goodbodies, Brockhouses and Proudfoots.  
'ProudFEET!' 
shouted  an  elderly  hobbit  from  the back  of the pavilion.  His name, of 
course, was  Proudfoot, and well merited; his feet were large, exceptionally 
furry, and both were on the table. 
     Proudfoots,  repeated Bilbo. Also my  good  Sackville -Bagginses that  I 
welcome  back at last  to  Bag  End. Today  is my  one  hundred and eleventh  
birthday: I am eleventy -one  today! 'Hurray!  Hurray! Many  Happy  Returns!' 
they  shouted, and they  hammered  joyously  on the tables.  Bilbo was doing 
splendidly. This was the sort of stuff they liked: short and obvious.  
     / hope you  are  all  enjoying yourselves as much as  I  am.  Deafening 
cheers. Cries  of  Yes  (and  No). Noises  of trumpets and horns, pipes  and 
flutes,  and  other musical instruments.  There were, as has been said, many 
young hobbits present. Hundreds of musical crackers had been pulled. Most of 
them bore the  mark DALE  on them; which did not  convey much to most of 
the 
hobbits, but they all agreed they were  marvellous crackers.  They contained 
instruments, small, but of perfect make and enchanting tones. Indeed, in one 
corner some of  the young Tooks and  Brandybucks, supposing Uncle  Bilbo  to 
have finished (since he had plainly said all that was necessary), now got up 
an impromptu orchestra, and began a  merry dance-tune.  Master  Everard Took  
and  Miss Melilot Brandybuck  got on a  table  and with bells in their hands 
began to dance the Springle-ring: a pretty dance, but rather vigorous. 
     But Bilbo had not finished. Seizing a horn from a youngster near by, he 
blew  three loud  hoots. The noise subsided. /  shall not keep you  long, he 
cried. Cheers from all the assembly. /  have called  you all  together for a  
Purpose. Something in  the way  that he said this made an impression.  There 
was almost silence, and one or two of the Tooks pricked up their ears. 
     Indeed,  for  Three  Purposes! First of  all,  to  tell  you that  I am 

####-immensely fond  of  you all, and that eleventy -one years is too short a time 
to live among such  excellent and  admirable hobbits. Tremendous outburst of 
approval. 
     / don't know half of you half as well as I should like; and I like less 
than half of you half as well as you deserve. This was unexpected and rather  
difficult. There  was some scattered clapping, but most of  them were trying 
to work it out and see if it came to a compliment. 
     Secondly,  to  celebrate my birthday.  Cheers again.  / should say: OUR 
birthday.  For it  is, of  course, also the birthday of my  heir and nephew,  
Frodo.  He comes  of  age  and into his inheritance today. Some  perfunctory 
clapping by the  elders;  and some loud  shouts of 'Frodo!  Frodo! Jolly old 
Frodo,' from the juniors. The Sackville-Bagginses scowled, and wondered what 
was  meant by 'coming  into his inheritance'. Together we score one  hundred  
and forty -four.  Your numbers were chosen to  fit this remarkable total: One 
Gross, if I  may use the  expression. No cheers. This was ridiculous. Many of 
his guests, and especially  the Sackville-Bagginses, were insulted,  feeling 
sure they had only been asked to fill up the  required number, like goods in 
a package. 'One Gross, indeed! Vulgar expression.' 
     It is also,  if  I  may be  allowed to  refer to  ancient history,  the 
anniversary of my arrival by barrel at Esgaroth on the Long Lake; though the 
fact that it was  my birthday slipped  my memory on that occasion. I was only  
fifty-one  then,  and birthdays did  not seem so important.  The banquet was  
very splendid, however, though I had a bad cold at the time, I remember, and 
could only say 'thag you very  buch'. I now repeat  it more correctly: Thank 
you  very  much for coming  to my little party. Obstinate  silence. They all  
feared that  a song or some poetry was now imminent;  and they  were getting 
bored. Why couldn't he stop talking and let them drink his health? But Bilbo  
did not sing or recite. He paused for a moment. 
     Thirdly  and finally, he said,  I wish to make an ANNOUNCEMENT. He 
spoke 
this last word so  loudly and suddenly that everyone sat up who still could. 
I regret to announce that - though, as I said, eleventy -one years is far too 
short a time to spend among you - this is the END. I am going. I  am leaving 
NOW. GOOD-BYE! 
     He stepped down and  vanished. There was a blinding flash of light, and 
the guests  all blinked. When they opened their eyes Bilbo was nowhere to be 
seen. One hundred  and forty-four flabbergasted hobbits sat back speechless.  

####-Old  Odo Proudfoot  removed his feet from the table and stamped. Then  there 
was  a  dead  silence,  until  suddenly, after  several deep breaths,  every 
Baggins,  Boffin,   Took,   Brandybuck,   Grubb,  Chubb,  Burrows,   Bolger, 
Bracegirdle,  Brockhouse, Goodbody, Hornblower, and  Proudfoot began to 
talk  
at once. 
     It  was generally agreed that the joke was  in very bad taste, and more 
food and drink were needed to cure the guests  of shock and annoyance. 'He's 
mad. I always said so,'  was probably  the  most  popular comment.  Even the 
Tooks (with a few exceptions) thought  Bilbo's behaviour was absurd. For the 
moment most of  them took it for granted that his disappearance was  nothing 
more than a ridiculous prank. 
     But old Rory Brandybuck was not  so sure. Neither age  nor an  enormous 
dinner  had clouded his wits, and he said to his daughter -in-law, Esmeralda: 
'There's something fishy in this, my dear! I believe that mad Baggins is off 
again. Silly old fool. But why worry? He hasn't taken the vittles with him.' 
He called loudly to Frodo to send the wine round again. 
     Frodo  was the only one present who had said nothing. For some time  he 
had  sat silent  beside  Bilbo's  empty  chair,  and ignored all remarks and 
questions. He had enjoyed the  joke,  of course, even  though he had been in 
the  know. He had  difficulty  in  keeping  from  laughter at the  indignant 
surprise of  the guests.  But  at the  same time he felt deeply troubled: he 
realized  suddenly  that he loved the old hobbit  dearly. Most of the guests 
went on eating and drinking and discussing Bilbo Baggins' oddities, past and 
present;  but the Sackville-Bagginses had already  departed in wrath.  Frodo 
did not want to have any more  to do with the party. He gave orders for more 
wine to be served; then he got up and drained his own glass  silently to the 
health of Bilbo, and slipped out of the pavilion. 
     As for Bilbo Baggins,  even while he was making his speech, he had been 
fingering the golden ring   in his pocket:  his magic ring that he  had  kept 
secret for so many years. As he  stepped  down he slipped it on his  finger, 
and he was never seen by any hobbit in Hobbiton again. 
     He walked  briskly back to his hole, and stood  for a moment  listening 
with a smile to the din in  the pavilion and to the sounds of merrymaking in 
other parts  of the field. Then he  went in.  He took off his party clothes,  
folded up and wrapped  in tissue-paper his  embroidered  silk waistcoat, and 
put it away. Then he put on quickly  some old untidy  garments, and fastened 

####-round his  waist a  worn leather  belt.  On it  he  hung a short sword in  a  
battered  black-leather  scabbard.  From  a  locked  drawer,   smelling   of 
moth-balls, he took out an old cloak and hood . They had been locked up as if 
they were very precious, but they were  so  patched and weatherstained  that 
their  original  colour  could hardly be guessed: it might  have  been  dark 
green. They were rather too large for him. He then  went into his study, and 
from  a  large  strong-box  took out a bundle  wrapped in  old cloths, and a  
leather -bound  manuscript; and  also a large bulky  envelope.  The  book and  
bundle  he stuffed  into  the top  of a heavy  bag  that was standing there, 
already nearly full.  Into the envelope he slipped his  golden ring, and its 
fine chain, and then  sealed it, and addressed it  to Frodo. At first he put 
it  on the mantelpiece,  but  suddenly  he  removed it and  stuck  it in his 
pocket. At that moment the door opened and Gandalf came quickly in. 
     'Hullo!' said Bilbo. 'I wondered if you would turn up.' 
     'I am glad to find you visible,' replied the wizard, sitting down  in a  
chair, 'I wanted to catch you and have a few final words. I suppose you feel 
that everything has gone off splendidly and according to plan?' 
     'Yes,  I do,' said  Bilbo. "Though that flash was surprising: it  quite 
startled  me,  let alone the  others. A  little  addition  of  your  own,  I 
suppose?' 
     It was. You have  wisely kept that ring secret all these  years, and it 
seemed to me necessary to give your guests something else that would seem to 
explain your sudden vanishment.' 
     'And would spoil my joke. You are an interfering old busybody,' laughed 
Bilbo, 'but I expect you know best, as usual.' 
     'I do - when I  know  anything. But I  don't  feel too  sure about this 
whole affair. It has now come  to the  final point. You have had  your joke, 
and alarmed or offended most  of your relations, and  given the whole  Shire 
something to talk about for nine  days, or ninety-nine more  likely. Are you  
going any further?' 
     'Yes, I am. I feel  I  need a holiday, a very  long holiday, as I  have 
told  you before. Probably  a  permanent holiday:  I  don't expect  I  shall 
return. In fact, I don't mean to, and I have made all arrangements. 
     'I  am  old, Gandalf. I don't look it, but I am beginning to feel it in 
my heart  of hearts.  Well-preserved indeed!' he snorted.  'Why, I feel  all 
thin, sort of stretched, if you  know what I mean: like butter that has been 
scraped  over too  much bread.  That can't  be right. I need  a  change,  or  

####-something.' 
     Gandalf  looked curiously  and closely at him.  'No,  it does not  seem 
right,' he said thoughtfully. 'No, after all I believe your plan is probably 
the best.' 
     'Well, I've made  up  my mind,  anyway. I  want to see mountains again, 
Gandalf, mountains, and then  find somewhere where I can  rest. In peace and 
quiet, without a lot  of relatives prying around, and a string of confounded 
visitors hanging on the bell.  I might find somewhere where I  can finish my 
book. I  have thought  of  a nice ending for it:  and he lived happily  ever 
after to the end of his days. ' 
     Gandalf laughed. I hope he will. But nobody will read the book, however  
it ends.' 
     'Oh, they may, in years to come. Frodo has read some already, as far as 
it has gone. You'll keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?' 
     'Yes, I will  - two eyes, as often as I can spare them.' 
     'He would come with  me, of  course, if I asked him. In fact he offered 
to once, just before the party. But he does not really want to, yet.  I want 
to  see  the  wild country again before I die, and  the Mountains; but he is 
still in love with the Shire, with woods and  fields  and  little rivers. He 
ought to  be comfortable here. I  am leaving everything  to him,  of course, 
except a few oddments. I  hope he will be happy,  when he gets used to being 
on his own. It's time he was his own master now.' 
     'Everything?' said Gandalf. 'The ring  as well? You agreed to that, you  
remember.' 
     'Well, er, yes, I suppose so,' stammered Bilbo.  
     'Where is it?' 
     'In an envelope, if you must know,'  said Bilbo impatiently. 'There  on 
the mantelpiece. Well,  no! Here it is in  my  pocket!' He hesitated.  'Isn't 
that odd now?'  he  said  softly  to himself. 'Yet after all,  why  not? Why 
shouldn't it stay there?' 
     Gandalf looked again very hard  at  Bilbo, and there was a gleam in his 
eyes.  'I think, Bilbo,' he said  quietly, 'I should leave  it behind. Don't  
you want to?' 
     'Well yes  - and no. Now it comes to it, I don't like parting with it at 
all, I may say. And I don't really see why I should. Why do you want me to?' 
he asked, and a  curious  change came  over  his voice.  It  was sharp  with 

####-suspicion and annoyance. 'You are always badgering me about my ring; but 
you 
have never bothered me about the other things that I got on my journey.' 
     'No, but I had to  badger  you,'  said Gandalf. 'I wanted the truth. It 
was  important. Magic  rings  are  - well, magical; and  they are  rare  and 
curious. I was  professionally interested in  your ring, you may say;  and I 
still am. I should like to know where it is, if you go wandering again. Also 
I  think you  have had  it quite long  enough. You won't need it  any  more. 
Bilbo, unless I am quite mistaken.' 
     Bilbo  flushed, and there  was an angry light in  his eyes.  His kindly 
face  grew hard. 'Why  not?'  he  cried. 'And what business is it of  yours, 
anyway, to know what I  do with my own things? It is my own. I found  it. It  
came to me.' 
     'Yes, yes,' said Gandalf. 'But there is no need to get angry.' 
     'If I am  it  is your  fault,' said Bilbo. 'It is mine, I  tell you. My 
own. My precious. Yes, my precious.' 
     The wizard's face remained grave and attentive,  and  only a flicker in 
his deep eyes showed that he  was startled and indeed  alarmed. 'It has been 
called that before,' he said,  'but not by you.' 
     'But I say it now. And why not? Even if Gollum said the same once. It's 
not his now, but mine. And I shall keep it, I say.' 
     Gandalf stood  up. He  spoke  sternly. 'You will be  a fool if  you do. 
Bilbo,' he said. 'You make that clearer with every word you say. It has  got 
far  too much  hold on you. Let it go! And then you can go yourself, and  be 
free.' 
     'I'll do as I choose and go as I please,' said Bilbo obstinately. 
     'Now, now, my dear hobbit!  ' said Gandalf. 'All your long life we have 
been  friends, and you owe me something. Come!  Do as you promised: give  it 
up!  ' 
     'Well,  if  you  want my ring yourself, say  so!' cried Bilbo. 'But you  
won't get it.  I won't give my precious away, I tell  you.' His hand strayed 
to the hilt of his small sword. 
     Gandalf's eyes flashed. It will be my turn to get angry soon,' he said. 
If  you  say  that again,  I shall.  Then  you  will  see Gandalf  the  Grey 
uncloaked.'  He took a step towards the hobbit,  and he seemed to  grow tall 
and menacing; his shadow filled the little room. 
     Bilbo backed away  to the  wall, brea thing hard, his hand  clutching at 

####-his pocket. They stood for a while facing one another,  and the  air of  the 
room tingled. Gandalf's  eyes remained bent on the hobbit. Slowly  his hands 
relaxed, and he began to tremble. 
     'I  don't know  what has  come  over  you, Gandalf,' he said. 'You have 
never been like this  before. What is it all  about? It is mine isn't it?  I 
found it, and Gollum would  have killed  me, if I hadn't kept it. I'm not  a  
thief, whatever he said.' 
     'I have  never called  you  one,' Gandalf answered. 'And  I  am not one 
either. I am not trying to rob you,  but to help you. I wish you would trust  
me,  as  you  used.' He turned  away, and the  shadow  passed. He  seemed to 
dwindle again to an old grey man, bent and troubled. 
     Bilbo drew his hand over his eyes. I am sorry,' he said. 'But I felt so 
queer.  And yet it would be a relief in a way not to be bothered with it any 
more. It has been so growing on my mind lately. Sometimes I have felt it was 
like an eye  looking at me.  And  I  am  always  wanting  to put it  on  and 
disappear, don't you know; or wondering if it is safe, and pulling it out to 
make sure. I tried locking it up, but  I found I couldn't rest without it in 
my pocket. I don't know why. And I don't seem able to make up my mind.' 
     'Then  trust mine,'  said Gandalf. 'It is quite  made  up.  Go away and 
leave it behind. Stop possessing it. Give it to Frodo, and I will look after  
him.' 
     Bilbo stood for a moment tense and undecided. Presently he sighed. 'All 
right,' he said with an effort. I will.' Then he shrugged his shoulders, and 
smiled rather ruefully. 'After  all that's what this party business  was all 
about, really: to  give away lots of birthday presents,  and somehow make it  
easier to give it away at the same time. It hasn't made it any easier in the 
end, but it would be  a pity  to waste  all my  preparations. It would quite 
spoil the joke.' 
     'Indeed  it would take  away the only point I ever saw in the  affair,' 
said Gandalf. 
     'Very well,' said Bilbo, 'it goes to Frodo  with all the rest.' He drew 
a  deep breath. 'And  now I  really must be starting, or somebody else  will 
catch  me.  I  have  said good-bye, and I couldn't bear  to  do it  all over  
again.' He picked up his bag and moved to the  door. 
     'You  have  still got the ring in your pocket,' said the wizard. 'Well, 
so I have!' cried Bilbo. 'And my will and  all  the other documents too. You  
had better take it and deliver it for me. That will be safest.' 

####-     'No,  don't give  the  ring  to  me,'  said  Gandalf. 'Put  it  on  the 
mantelpiece. It will be safe enough  there, till Frodo comes.  I  shall wait 
for him.' 
     Bilbo took out the envelope, but just as  he was about to set it by the 
clock, his hand jerked back, and the  packet fell  on  the floor.  Before he 
could pick it up, the wizard stooped and seized it and  set it in its place. 
A spasm  of anger passed swiftly over  the hobbit's  face again. Suddenly it 
gave way to a look of relief and a laugh. 'Well, that's that,' he said.  'Now 
I'm off!' 
     They went out into the hall.  Bilbo chose  his favourite stick from the 
stand; then he  whistled.  Three  dwarves came out of  different rooms where 
they had been busy. 
     'Is everything ready?' asked Bilbo. 'Everything packed and la belled?' 
     'Everything,' they answered. 
     'Well, let's start then!' He stepped out of the front-door. 
     It was a fine night, and the black sky was dotted with stars. He looked 
up,  sniffing  the air. 'What fun! What fun to be off again, off on the  Road 
with dwarves!  This  is  what  I  have  really  been longing for, for years! 
Good-bye!  ' he said, looking  at  his old  home and  bowing  to  the  door. 
'Good-bye, Gandalf!' 
     'Good-bye, for the present,  Bilbo. Take  care of yourself! You are old 
enough, and perhaps wise enough.' 
     'Take care! I  don't care. Don't  you worry about me! I am as happy now 
as I have ever been, and that is saying a great deal. But the time has come. 
I am being swept off my feet at last,' he added, and then in a low voice, as 
if to himself, he sang softly in the dark: 
     The Road goes ever on and on  
     Down from the door where it began. 
     Now far ahead the Road has gone, 
     And I must follow, if I can, 
     Pursuing it with eager feet, 
     Until it joins some larger way 
     Where many paths and errands meet. 
     And whither then? I cannot say. 
     He  paused, silent for a moment.  Then without another  word he  turned 
away from the lights and voices in the fields and tents, and followed by his 
three  companions  went round  into  his garden,  and trotted  down the long  

####-sloping path. He  jumped over  a low place in the hedge  at the bottom,  and  
took to the meadows, passing into the night like a  rustle  of wind  in  the 
grass. 
     Gandalf  remained for a  while  staring  after  him  into the darkness. 
'Goodbye,  my dear Bilbo  - until our next meeting!' he said softly and went 
back indoors. 
     Frodo came  in soon afterwards, and found him sitting in the dark, deep 
in thought. 'Has he gone?' he asked. 
     'Yes,' answered Gandalf, 'he has gone at last.' 
     ' I wish - I mean, I hoped until this evening that it was only a joke,' 
said Frodo. 'But I knew in my heart  that he  really  meant to go. He always 
used to  joke about serious things. I  wish  I had come back sooner, just to 
see him off.' 
     I  think really  he preferred slipping off quietly  in the  end,'  said 
Gandalf. 'Don't be too troubled. He'll be all right -  now. He left a packet 
for you. There it is!' 
     Frodo  took the envelope from the mantelpiece, and  glanced  at it, but 
did not open it. 
     'You'll find  his  will and all the other documents in there, I think,' 
said  the  wizard.  'You  are  the master of Bag End now. And also, I fancy, 
you'll find a golden ring.' 
     'The ring!' exclaimed Frodo. 'Has he left me that? I wonder why. Still, 
it may be useful.' 
     'It may, and it  may  not,' said Gandalf. 'I should not make use of it, 
if I were you. But keep it secret, and keep it safe! Now I am going to bed.' 
     As master of Bag End Frodo felt  it his painful duty to say good-bye to 
the guests. Rumours of strange events had by  now spread all over the field,  
but  Frodo would  only say  no doubt everything will be  cleared  up  in the 
morning.  About  midnight carriages  came for the important folk. One by one 
they rolled away, filled with full but  very  unsatisfied hobbits. Gardeners 
came   by  arrangement,   and  removed  in  wheel-barrows  those   that  had 
inadvertently remained behind. 
     Night slowly  passed.  The  sun  rose. The  hobbits rose  rather later. 
Morning  went  on.  People  came  and began (by  orders) to  clear away  the 
pavilions  and the  tables  and the chairs,  and the  spoons and  knives and 
bottles and plates, and the lanterns, and the flowering shrubs in boxes, and 
the  crumbs  and   cracker -paper,  the  forgotten   bags  and   gloves   and 

####-handkerchiefs,  and  the uneaten food (a very small  item). Then a number of 
other people came (without orders): Bagginses, and Boffins, and Bolgers, and 
Tooks, and other  guests that lived or  were staying near.  By mid-day, when 
even the best -fed were out and about again,  there  was a large crowd at Bag 
End, uninvited but not unexpected. 
     Frodo  was waiting on the step, smiling, but  looking rather  tired and 
worried. He welcomed all  the callers,  but he had not much more to say than 
before. His reply to all inquiries  was simply this: 'Mr. Bilbo  Baggins has 
gone away; as far as I know, for good.'  Some of  the visitors he invited to 
come inside, as Bilbo had left 'messages' for them. 
     Inside in the  hall there  was piled a large assortment of packages and 
parcels and small articles  of furniture.  On  every item there was  a label 
tied. There were several labels of this sort: 
     For ADELARD TOOK, for his VERY OWN, from Bilbo, on an umbrella. 
Adelard 
had carried off many unlabelled ones. 
     For  DORA BAGGINS in  memory  of  a LONG correspondence, with love 
from 
Bilbo, on a large waste-paper basket. Dora was Drogo's sister and the eldest  
surviving female  relative of Bilbo and Frodo; she was ninety-nine,  and had 
written reams of good advice for more than half a century. 
     For  MILO BURROWS,  hoping it will be  useful, from B.B., on a gold pen 
and ink -bottle. Milo never answered letters.  
     For ANGELICA'S use, from Uncle Bilbo, on a round convex mirror. She 
was 
a young Baggins, and too obviously considered her face shapely. 
     For  the  collection  of HUGO BRACEGIRDLE,  from a  contributor,  on an 
(empty) book -case. Hugo was a great borrower of books, and worse than  usual 
at returning them. 
     For LOBELIA SACKVILLE-BAGGINS,  as  a PRESENT,  on  a  case  of  
silver 
spoons. Bilbo  believed that  she had  acquired a good  many of  his spoons,  
while he was away  on his former journey. Lobelia knew that quite well. When 
she arrived later in the day, she took the point  at once, but she also took  
the spoons.  
     This  is  only  a  small  selection of  the assembled presents. Bilbo's 
residence had got rather cluttered up  with things in the course of his long 

####-life.  It was a  tendency of hobbit-holes to get cluttered up: for which the 
custom of giving so many birthday-presents was largely responsible.  Not, of 
course,  that the  birthday-presents  were always new,  there were one or two 
old mathoms  of forgotten uses that had circulated all around  the district; 
but Bilbo had usually given new presents, and  kept  those that he received. 
The old hole was now being cleared a little. 
     Every  one  of  the various  parting  gifts  had  labels,  written  out 
personally  by Bilbo,  and several had some point,  or  some  joke.  But, of 
course,  most  of the  things were  given where  they  would  be  wanted and 
welcome. The  poorer hobbits, and especially  those of Bagshot Row, did very 
well. Old Gaffer  Gamgee got  two sacks of potatoes, a new spade, a  woollen 
waistcoat,  and  a   bottle  of  ointment  for  creaking  joints.  Old  Rory 
Brandybuck,  in  return  for  much  hospitality, got a dozen  bottles of Old 
Winyards: a strong red wine from the Southfarthing, and now quite mature, as 
it had been laid down by Bilbo's father. Rory quite forgave Bilbo, and voted 
him a capital fellow after the first bottle. 
     There was plenty of everything left for Frodo.  And, of course, all the 
chief  treasures, as well  as  the  books,  pictures, and  more than  enough 
furniture,  were  left  in his possession. There was,  however, no sign  nor  
mention of money or jewellery: not a  penny-piece or  a glass bead was given 
away. 
     Frodo had a  very  trying time that afternoon. A fa lse rumour  that the 
whole household was being distributed free spread like wildfire; and  before 
long  the place was packed with  people who had no business there, but could 
not be kept out. Labels got torn off and mixed, and quarrels broke out. Some  
people tried to do swaps and deals in the hall; and others tried to make off 
with minor  items not  addressed to  them,  or  with  anything  that  seemed 
unwanted  or unwatched.  The road to the gate  was blocked  with barrows and 
handcarts.  
     In the middle of  the  commotion the Sackville-Bagginses arrived. Frodo  
had retired for a while and left his  friend Merry Brandybuck to keep an eye 
on things. When Otho loudly demanded to see Frodo, Merry bowed politely.  
     'He is indisposed,' he said. 'He is resting.' 
     'Hiding, you mean,'  said  Lobelia. 'Anyway we want  to see him and  we 
mean to see him. Just go and tell him so!' 
     Merry left them a long while in the hall, and they had time to discover  
their parting gift  of spoons. It did  not improve their tempers. Eventually 

####-they were shown into the study. Frodo was sitting at a  table with a lot  of 
papers in front of him. He looked indisposed - to see Sackville-Bagginses at 
any  rate;  and he stood up,  fidgeting with something in his pocket. But he 
spoke quite politely. 
     The Sackville-Bagginses were  rather offensive. They began  by offering 
him  bad  bargain-prices  (as between  friends)  for  various  valuable  and 
unlabelled  things.  When  Frodo  replied  that  only  the  things specially 
directed by Bilbo were being given away, they said the whole affair was very 
fishy. 
     'Only one thing  is clear to me,' said Otho, 'and that  is that you are 
doing exceedingly well out of it. I insist on seeing the will.' 
     Otho would  have been Bilbo's heir, but for  the  adoption of Frodo. He 
read the will carefully and  snorted. It was,  unfortunately, very clear and 
correct (according to the legal customs of hobbits, which demand among other  
things seven signatures of witnesses in red ink). 
     'Foiled again!' he said  to his  wife. 'And after waiting sixty   years.  
Spoons? Fiddlesticks!' He snapped his fingers under Frodo's nose and slumped 
off. But Lobelia was not so easily got rid of. A little later Frodo came out 
of the study  to see how things were going  on and found her still about the 
place, investigating nooks  and comers and  tapping the  floors. He escorted 
her firmly off the premises, after he had relieved her of several small (but 
rather valuable) articles that had somehow fallen inside  her umbrella.  Her  
face looked as if  she was in the throes of thinking out a  really  crushing 
parting remark; but all she found to say, turning round on the step, was:  
     'You'll live to regret  it, young  fellow! Why  didn't you  go too? You  
don't belong here; you're no Baggins  - you - you're a Brandybuck!' 
     'Did you hear that, Merry? That was an insult, if you like,' said Frodo 
as he shut the door on her. 
     'It was a compliment,' said Merry  Brandybuck, 'and so, of  course, not 
true.' 
     Then they went  round the hole,  and  evicted three  young hobbits (two 
Boffins and a Bolger) who were knocking  holes  in the  walls  of one of the 
cellars.  Frodo  also had a  tussle  with young Sancho  Proudfoot  (old  Odo 
Proudfoot's  grandson),  who had  begun an  excavation in the larger pantry, 
where  he thought there was an echo. The legend of Bilbo's gold excited both 
curiosity  and  hope;  for legendary  gold  (mysteriously obtained,  if  not  
positively ill-gotten), is, as every  one  knows, any one's for  the  finding 

####--unless the search is interrupted. 
     When he had overcome  Sancho and  pushed him out, Frodo  collapsed on a  
chair in the hall. It's time to  close the shop, Merry,'  he said. 'Lock the 
door, and don't open it to anyone today,  not even if they bring a battering 
ram.' Then he went to revive himself with a belated cup of tea. 
     He had hardly sat down, when there came a soft knock at the front-door. 
'Lobelia again most likely,' he thought. 'She must have thought of something 
really nasty, and have come back again to say it. It can wait.' 
     He went on  with his tea.  The knock was repeated,  much louder, but he 
took no notice. Suddenly the wizard's head appeared at the window.  
     'If you don't let me in, Frodo, I  shall blow your door right down your 
hole and out through the hill,' he said. 
     'My dear Gandalf! Half a  minute!' cried Frodo, running out of the room 
to the door. 'Come in! Come in! I thought it was Lobelia.' 
     'Then I  forgive you.  But I saw her some time ago, driving a pony-trap 
towards Bywater with a face that would have curdled new milk.' 
     'She had already nearly curdled me. Honestly, I nearly tried on Bilbo's 
ring. I longed to disappear.' 
     'Don't do that!'  said  Gandalf, sitting down. 'Do be  careful of  that 
ring, Frodo! In fact, it is partly about that that I have come to say a last 
word.' 
     'Well, what about it?' 
     'What do you know already?' 
     'Only  what Bilbo told me. I have heard his story: how he found it, and 
how he used it: on his journey, I mean.' 
     'Which story, I wonder,' said Gandalf.  
     'Oh, not what he told the dwarves and put in his book,' said Frodo. 'He 
told me  the  true story  soon after I  came to live here.  He said  you had 
pestered him till he told you, so I had better know too. "No secrets between 
us,  Frodo,"  he  said;  "but  they are not  to go  any  further. It's  mine 
anyway."' 
     'That's interesting,' said Gandalf.  'Well,  what did  you  think of it 
all?' 
     'If you mean, inventing all that about a "present",  well, I thought the 
true story much more likely, and I  couldn't see the point of altering it at 
all. It was very  unlike Bilbo to do  so,  anyway; and I thought  it  rather  
odd.' 

####-     'So did I. But odd things may happen to people that have such treasures 
- if  they use them. Let it be a warning to you to be very careful  with it. 
It may have other powers than just making you vanish when you wish to.' 
     'I don't understand,' said Frodo. 
     'Neither do I,'  answered  the wizard. 'I have  merely begun  to wonder  
about the ring,  especially since last night. No need to worry.  But if  you  
take my  advice you will use it very  seldom, or not at  all. At least I beg 
you not  to use it in any way that will cause talk or rouse suspicion. I say 
again: keep it safe, and keep it secret!' 
     'You are very mysterious! What are you afraid of?' 
     'I am not certain, so I  will say no  more. I may  be able to  tell you  
something  when I come back. I am going off at once: so this is good-bye for 
the present.' He got up. 
     'At  once!' cried Frodo.  'Why,  I thought  you were staying  on for at 
least a week. I was looking forward to your help.' 
     'I did mean to  - but I have had to change my mind. I  may be away for a  
good while;  but  I'll come and see you again, as soon  as I  can. Expect me 
when you see me! I shall  slip in quietly.  I  shan't often be visiting  the 
Shire openly again.  I find that I have become rather unpopular. They  say I 
am a  nuisance  and  a  disturber  of the  peace. Some people  are  actually 
accusing me of spiriting Bilbo away, or worse. If you want to know, there is 
supposed to be a plot between you and me to get hold of his wealth.' 
     'Some  people!'  exclaimed Frodo.  'You  mean  Otho  and  Lobelia.  How 
abominable!  I would give  them Bag  End and everything else, if I could get  
Bilbo back  and go off tramping in the country with  him. I  love the Shire. 
But I begin to  wish, somehow, that I had gone too. I wonder if I shall ever  
see him again.' 
     'So do I,' said Gandalf. 'And  I wonder many other things. Good-bye now!  
Take  care  of  yourself!  Look out  for  me, especially at  unlikely times!  
Good-bye!' 
     Frodo saw him to the door. He gave a final wave of his hand, and walked 
off at a surprising pace; but Frodo  thought the  old wizard looked unusually 
bent, almost  as if  he was carrying a great weight. The evening was closing 
in, and his cloaked figure quickly vanished into the twilight. Frodo did not 
see him again for a long time. 
 
 

####-<h4>Chapter 2.</h4> <br> The Shadow of the Past 

 
 
     The talk did not die down in nine  or even ninety-nine days. The second 
disappearance of Mr. Bilbo Baggins was discussed in Hobbiton, and indeed all 
over the Shire,  for a year  and a day,  and was remembered much longer than 
that.  It became  a fireside -story for  young  hobbits;  and eventually  Mad 
Baggins,  who used to vanish with a  bang and a flash and reappear with bags 
of jewels and gold, became a favourite character of legend and lived on long  
after all the true events were forgotten. 
     But in the meantime, the general opinion in the  neighbourhood was that 
Bilbo, who  had always been rather cracked, had at  last gone quite mad, and  
had run off into the Blue. There he had  undoubtedly fallen into a pool or a  
river and  come to a tragic,  but  hardly an  untimely, end.  The blame  was 
mostly laid on Gandalf. 
     'If only that  dratted  wizard will leave young  Frodo  alone,  perhaps 
he'll  settle  down  and  grow some  hobbit-sense,'  they said. And  to  all 
appearance the wizard did leave Frodo alone, and he did settle down, but the  
growth of hobbit-sense was not very noticeable. Indeed, he at once  began to  
carry on Bilbo's reputation for oddity. He  refused to go into mourning; and 
the next  year  he gave a party  in  honour of  Bilbo's  hundred-and-twelfth 
birthday, which he  called Hundred-weight Feast. But that was  short  of the 
mark, for twenty guests were invited  and  there were several meals at which  
it snowed food and rained drink, as hobbits say. 
     Some people were rather shocked; but Frodo kept up the custom of giving 
Bilbo's  Birthday Party year after year  until  they got used to it. He said 
that he did not think Bilbo  was dead. When  they asked: 'Where is he then?' 
he shrugged his shoulders. 
     He lived  alone, as Bilbo had done; but he  had  a  good  many friends, 
especially among  the younger hobbits  (mostly descendants  of the Old Took) 
who  had  as children been fond of  Bilbo  and often in and out of Bag  End.  
Folco Boffin and Fredegar  Bolger were two of these; but his closest friends 
were Peregrin Took (usually called Pippin),  and Merry Brandybuck  (his real 
name was Meriadoc, but  that was seldom remembered). Frodo went tramping 
all 
over  the Shire with them; but more often he wandered by himself, and to the 
amazement of  sensible folk he was sometimes  seen far  from home walking in 

####-the hills and woods under the starlight.  Merry and Pippin suspected that he 
visited the Elves at times, as Bilbo had done. 
     As time went on, people began to notice that Frodo also showed signs of 
good 'preservation':  outwardly he retained the appearance  of a  robust and 
energetic hobbit just out of his tweens. 'Some folk have all the luck,' they 
said;  but it was not until Frodo approached the  usually more  sober age of 
fifty that they began to think it queer. 
     Frodo himself, after the first shock, found  that being his  own master  
and the Mr. Baggins of Bag End  was rather  pleasant. For some  years he was 
quite  happy and did not  worry much about the  future. But half unknown  to 
himself the regret that he had not gone with Bilbo was  steadily growing. He 
found himself  wondering at times,  especially in the autumn, about the wild 
lands, and strange visions of mountains that he had never seen came into his 
dreams. He began to sa y to himself: 'Perhaps I shall cross the  River myself 
one day.' To which the other half of his mind always replied: 'Not yet.' 
     So it  went on,  until his forties were  running  out, and his fiftieth 
birthday  was  drawing  near:  fifty  was a number   that he felt was somehow 
significant (or ominous); it was at any  rate at that age that adventure had 
suddenly  befallen  Bilbo. Frodo began to feel  restless, and the  old paths 
seemed too well-trodden. He  looked at maps, and  wondered  what lay  beyond 
their edges: maps made  in the Shire showed  mostly  white spaces beyond its 
borders.  He took to wandering further afield and more often by himself; and 
Merry and his other friends watched him anxiously. Often he was seen walking 
and talking with the strange  wayfarers that began at this time to appear in 
the Shire. 
     There were rumours of  strange things happening in the  world  outside; 
and as Gandalf had not at that time appeared or sent any message for several 
years, Frodo gathered all the news he could. Elves, who seldom walked in the 
Shire, could  now be seen passing westward through the woods in the evening, 
passing and  not returning; but they were leaving Middle-earth and  were  no  
longer concerned with its troubles. There were, however, dwarves on the road 
in  unusual numbers. The ancient East -West Road ran through the Shire to its 
end at the Grey Havens, and dwarves had always used it on their way to their 
mines in the Blue Mountains. They  were the  hobbits' chief  source of  news 
from distant parts  - if they  wanted any: as a rule  dwarves said little and 
hobbits  asked  no  more.  But now Frodo  often met strange dwarves  of  far  
countries, seeking refuge in the West. They were troubled, and some spoke in 

####-whispers of the Enemy and of the Land of Mordor. 
     That name  the hobbits  only knew in legends  of the  dark past, like a  
shadow  in  the  background  of their  memories;  but  it  was  ominous  and 
disquieting. It seemed that the  evil power in Mirkwood had been  driven out 
by the White Council  only  to  reappear  in  greater  strength  in the  old 
strongholds of Mordor. The  Dark Tower had been rebuilt,  it was  said. From 
there the  power was spreading far and  wide,  and away far  east  and south 
there were  wars and  growing  fear.  Orcs were  multiplying  again  in  the  
mountains. Trolls were abroad, no longer dull-witted, but  cunning and armed 
with  dreadful  weapons.  And there  were  murmured  hints of creatures more 
terrible than all these, but they had no name. 
     Little of all this,  of  course, reached the ears of  ordinary hobbits. 
But  even the deafest  and most stay-at-home began to hear queer  tales; and 
those whose business  took  them  to  the  borders  saw strange  things. The 
conversation in The  Green Dragon at Bywater,  one evening in the spring  of 
Frodo's  fiftieth year,  showed that  even in the comfortable  heart of  the 
Shire rumours had been heard, though most hobbits still laughed at them. 
     Sam Gamgee was sitting in one  corner near the fire,  and opposite  him 
was Ted  Sandyman, the  miller's son;  and there  were various  other rustic 
hobbits listening to their talk. 
     'Queer things you do hear these days, to be sure,' said Sam. 
     'Ah,'  said  Ted, 'you do, if you listen. But I can hear fireside-tales 
and children's stories at home, if I want to.' 
     'No doubt you can,' retorted Sam, 'and I daresay  there's more truth in 
some of them than you reckon.  Who invented the stories anyway? Take 
dragons 
now.' 
     'No thank 'ee,' said  Ted, 'I won't.  I heard tell of them when I was a  
youngster, but there's no  call to  believe in  them  now. There's  only one 
Dragon in Bywater, and that's Green,' he said, getting a general laugh. 
     'All  right,' said  Sam, laughing with the rest. 'But  what about these 
Tree-men, these giants, as you might call  them? They do say that one bigger 
than a tree was seen up away beyond the North Moors not long back.' 
     'Who's they?' 
     'My cousin Hal for one. He works for Mr. Boffin at Overhill and goes up 
to the Northfarthing for the hunting. He saw one.' 
     'Says he did, perhaps. Your Hal's always saying  he's seen  things; and 

####-maybe he sees things that ain't there.' 
     'But  this  one was as big  as an elm tree, and walking - walking seven 
yards to a stride, if it was an inch.' 
     'Then I bet it wasn't an inch. What he saw was an elm  tree, as like as 
not.' 
     'But this one was  walking, I tell you; and there  ain't no elm tree on 
the North Moors.' 
     'Then Hal can't have  seen one,' said Ted. There  was some laughing and 
clapping: the audience seemed to think that Ted had scored a point. 
     'All  the same,'  said  Sam,  'you can't deny  that others besides  our 
Halfast have seen  queer  folk crossing the  Shire  - crossing  it, mind you: 
there are more that are turned back at the borders. The Bounders  have never  
been so busy before. 
     'And I've heard tell  that Elves are moving west. They do  say they are 
going to the harbours, out away beyond the  White Towers.' Sam waved his 
arm 
vaguely: neither he nor  any of them knew how far it was to the Sea, past the 
old towers  beyond  the western borders  of the  Shire. But  it was  an  old 
tradition that  away over  there stood the Grey  Havens, from which at times 
elven-ships set sail, never to return. 
     'They are sailing,  sailing, sailing over the Sea,  they are going into 
the West  and  leaving us,' said  Sam, half chanting the words, shaking  his 
head sadly and solemnly. But Ted laughed. 
     'Well,  that isn't anything  new, if you believe the  old tales.   And I 
don't see  what it matters to me or you.  Let  them sail!  But I warrant you  
haven't seen them doing it; nor any one else in the Shire.' 
     'Well I don't  know,' said Sam  thoughtfully. He believed he  had  once 
seen an Elf in the  woods, and still hoped to  see more one  day. Of all the 
legends  that he had heard in his  early  years such fragments of tales  and 
half-remembered  stories  about  the Elves as the hobbits knew,  had  always 
moved him  most deeply. 'There  are some,  even in these parts, as  know the 
Fair Folk and get news  of them,'  he said. 'There's Mr. Baggins now, that I 
work for. He told me  that they were sailing and he knows a bit about Elves.  
And old Mr. Bilbo knew more:  many's the  talk I had with  him  when I was a  
little lad.' 
     'Oh, they're both cracked,' said Ted. 'Leastways old Bilbo was cracked, 
and Frodo's cracking. If that's where  you get your news from, you'll  never  

####-want for moonshine. Well,  friends,  I'm  off home.  Your  good  health!' He 
drained his mug and  went out noisily. 
     Sam sat silent and said no more. He had a good deal to think about. For  
one thing, there was a lot to do up in the Bag End garden, and he would have 
a busy day tomorrow, if the weather cleared. The grass was growing fast. But 
Sam ha d more on his mind than gardening. After a while he sighed, and got up 
and went out. 
     It was  early April and the sky was now clearing after  heavy rain. The 
sun was down,  and  a cool  pale evening was quietly fading  into night.  He 
walked  home  under  the  early stars  through  Hobbiton and  up  the  Hill, 
whistling softly and thoughtfully. 
     It  was  just at  this  time that  Gandalf  reappeared  after his  long 
absence. For three years  after  the Party he had  been away.  Then he  paid 
Frodo a  brief visit,  and after taking a good look at him he went off again. 
During  the  next  year  or  two  he  had  turned  up  fairly often,  coming 
unexpectedly  after  dusk, and going off without warning before sunrise.  He 
would  not  discuss  his  own  business  and  journeys, and  seemed  chiefly 
interested in small news about Frodo's health and doings. 
     Then suddenly his visits had ceased. It was over nine years since Frodo 
had seen or heard of him, and  he had begun  to think that  the wizard would 
never return and  had given up all interest in hobbits. But that evening, as 
Sam was walking home  and twilight was fading, there came the once  familiar 
tap on the study window.  
     Frodo welcomed  his old friend with  surprise  and great delight.  They 
looked hard at one another. 
     'Ah well eh?' said Gandalf. 'You look the same as ever, Frodo!' 
     'So do you,' Frodo replied; but secretly he thought that Gandalf looked 
older and  more careworn. He pressed him for news of himself and of the wide 
world, and  soon they were  deep in talk, and  they stayed  up far into  the 
night. 
     Next morning after a late breakfast, the  wizard was sitting with Frodo 
by the open  window of the  study. A bright fire was on the hearth,  but the 
sun was warm, and  the  wind was in the  South. Everything looked fresh, and 
the new green of Spring  was shimmering in the fields and on the tips of the  
trees' fingers.  
     Gandalf  was thinking of  a  spring,  nearly  eighty years before, when 
Bilbo  had run out  of Bag End without  a handkerchief. His hair was perhaps 

####-whiter  than it  had  been  then,  and his  beard  and eyebrows were perhaps 
longer, and  his face more lined with care and  wisdom; but his eyes were as 
bright as ever, and he smoked and blew smoke-rings with the same vigour  and 
delight. 
     He was  smoking  now in  silence, for  Frodo was sitting still, deep in 
thought. Even in the light of morning he felt the dark shadow of the tidings 
that Gandalf had brought. At last he broke the silence. 
     'Last  night  you  began to  tell  me  strange  things  about  my ring, 
Gandalf,' he said. 'And then you stopped, because you said that such matters 
were best left until  daylight. Don't you think  you  had better finish now?  
You  say the ring  is dangerous,  far mor e  dangerous than  I guess. In what 
way?' 
     'In many  ways,' answered  the wizard. It is far  more powerful than  I 
ever dared to think at first, so powerful that in the  end it  would utterly 
overcome anyone of mortal race who possessed it. It would possess him. 
     'In Eregion long  ago many Elven-rings  were made,  magic  rings as you  
call them, and they were, of course, of various  kinds: some more potent and 
some  less.  The lesser rings were only essays  in the craft before  it  was 
full-grown, and to the Elven-smiths they were but  trifles  - yet still to my 
mind dangerous for mortals. But  the Great Rings,  the Rings of Power,  they 
were perilous.  
     'A  mortal, Frodo, who keeps one of the Great  Rings, does not die, but 
he does not  grow  or obtain more life, he merely continues, until  at  last 
every minute is a weariness. And if he often  uses the Ring  to make himself 
invisible,  he fades: he becomes in the end invisible permanently, and walks 
in the twilight under the eye of the  dark power that rules the Rings.  Yes, 
sooner or  later  - later, if he is strong or well-meaning to begin with, but 
neither strength nor good purpose will last  - sooner or later the dark power  
will devour him.' 
     'How terrifying!' said Frodo. There was another long silence. The sound 
of Sam Gamgee cutting the lawn came in from the garden. 
     'How long have you  known this?'  asked Frodo  at length. 'And how much 
did Bilbo know?' 
     'Bilbo knew no  more than he told you, I  am  sure,' said Gandalf.  'He 
would certainly never have  passed on  to you anything that he thought would 
be a danger, even though I  promised to  look after you. He thought the ring  
was very beautiful, and very  useful at  need;  and if anything was wrong or 

####-queer, it was himself. He said that it was "growing on his mind", and he was 
always worrying about it; but he did not suspect that the ring itself was to 
blame.  Though he had found out that  the thing needed looking after; it did 
not seem always of the same size or weight; it shrank or expanded  in an odd 
way, and might suddenly slip off a finger where it had been tight.' 
     'Yes, he warned me of that in his last letter,' said Frodo,  'so I have 
always kept it on its chain.' 
     'Very wise,'  said Gandalf.  'But  as for  his long life,   Bilbo  never  
connected  it  with the  ring  at all. He took  all  the credit  for that to 
himself,  and he was very  proud of  it. Though  he was getting restless and 
uneasy.  Thin and  stretched  he  said. A  sign  that  the  ring was getting 
control.' 
     'How long have you known all this?' asked Frodo again. 
     'Known?'  said  Gandalf.  'I  have known  much that only the Wise know,  
Frodo. But  if you mean "known about this ring", well,  I still do not know,  
one might say. There is a last test to make. But I no longer doubt my guess.  
     'When did I first begin to guess?' he mused, searching back  in memory. 
'Let me see - it was in the year that the White Council drove the dark power  
from Mirkwood,  just before the Battle of Five  Armies, that Bilbo found his 
ring.  A  shadow  fell on my  heart then, though  I did not know  yet what I 
feared. I wondered often how Gollum came  by a Great Ring, as plainly it was 
- that at least was clear from the first. Then I heard Bilbo's strange story 
of how he had "won" it, and I  could not believe it. When I at last  got the 
truth out of him,  I saw at once that he had been trying to put his claim to 
the  ring beyond  doubt. Much like Gollum  with his "birthday  present". The 
lies were too much alike for my comfort.  Clearly the ring had an unwholesome 
power  that  set to  work on  its keeper at once.  That was the  first  real 
warning I had that all was not well. I told Bilbo often that such rings were 
better left unused; but he resented it, and soon got angry. There was little 
else that I could  do.  I could not take it  from him without doing  greater  
harm; and  I had no right to  do so anyway. I could only watch  and wait.  I 
might perhaps have consulted Saruman the White, but something always held 
me 
back.' 
     'Who is he?' asked Frodo. I have never heard of him before.' 
     'Maybe  not,' answered Gandalf. 'Hobbits  are, or were,  no concern  of 
his. Yet he is great among the Wise.  He  is the  chief of  my order and the 

####-head of the Council. His knowledge is deep, but his pride has grown with it,  
and he takes ill any meddling. The lore of the Elven-rings, great and small, 
is  his province. He  has long studied it, seeking the lost secrets of their 
making; but when the  Rings  were debated  in the Council, all that he would  
reveal to us of his ring-lore told against my fears. So my doubt slept  - but 
uneasily. Still I watched and I waited. 
     'And all  seemed well  with  Bilbo. And  the  years  passed. Yes,  they 
passed, and  they seemed  not to touch him.  He showed no signs of age.  The 
shadow fell  on me  again. But I said  to  myself: "After all he comes of  a  
long-lived family on his mother's side. There is time yet. Wait!" 
     'And  I waited.  Until  that night when he left this house. He said and 
did things then that  filled me with a  fear that no words  of Saruman could 
allay. I knew at last that something dark and deadly was at work. And I have  
spent most of the years since then in finding out the truth of it.' 
     'There  wasn't  any  permanent  harm  done,  was  there?'  asked  Frodo 
anxiously. 'He would  get all right in time, wouldn't he? Be able to rest in 
peace, I mean?' 
     'He felt better at once,' said Gandalf. 'But there is only one Power in 
this world that knows all about the Rings and their effects; and as far as I 
know there is no Power  in the world that knows all about hobbits. Among the 
Wise I  am  the only one that goes in for hobbit-lore: an obscure branch  of 
knowledge, but  full  of surprises.  Soft as  butter  they  can be,  and yet 
sometimes as tough as old  tree-roots.  I  think it likely  that  some would  
resist the  Rings far longer  than most of the Wise  would believe.  I don't 
think you need worry about Bilbo. 
     'Of  course, he possessed the ring  for many years,  and used it,  so it 
might take a long while for the  influence to  wear off  - before it was safe 
for him to see it  again, for  instance.  Otherwise,  he might  live on  for  
years,  quite happily: just stop  as  he was when he parted with  it. For he 
gave it up in the end of his own accord: an important point. No, I  was  not 
troubled about dear Bilbo any more, once he had let the  thing go. It is for  
you that I feel responsible. 
     'Ever  since  Bilbo left  I have been deeply concerned  about you,  and 
about all  these charming, absurd, helpless  hobbits. It would be a grievous 
blow to the world, if  the Dark Power overcame the Shire; if all  your kind, 
jolly, stupid Bolgers, Hornblowers, Boffins, Bracegirdles, and the rest, not 
to mention the ridiculous Bagginses, became enslaved.' 

####-     Frodo shuddered. 'But why  should we be?'  he asked. 'And why should he 
want such slaves?' 
     'To tell you the  truth,' replied Gandalf,  'I  believe that hitherto - 
hitherto,  mark you - he has entirely overlooked the existence  of   hobbits.  
You should be thankful. But your  safety has passed. He does not need you   - 
he  has  many  more useful  servants   -  but  he won't forget you again. And 
hobbits as miserable slaves would please him far more than hobbits happy and 
free. There is  such a thing as malice and revenge.' 
     'Revenge?' said Frodo. 'Revenge for what? I still don't understand what 
all this has to do with Bilbo and myself, and our ring.' 
     'It has everything to do with  it,' said Gandalf. 'You do  not know the 
real peril  yet; but  you shall. I was not sure of it myself when I was last  
here; but the time has come to speak. Give me the ring for a moment.' 
     Frodo took it from his breeches-pocket, where it was clasped to a chain 
that hung  from  his  belt. He unfastened  it  and handed  it slowly  to the 
wizard. It felt suddenly very heavy, as if either it or Frodo himself was in 
some way reluctant for Gandalf to touch it. 
     Gandalf held it up. It looked  to be  made of pure and solid gold. 'Can 
you see any markings  on it?' he asked. 
     'No,'  said  Frodo. 'There  are none. It is quite  plain,  and it never  
shows a scratch or sign of wear.' 
     'Well  then, look!'  To Frodo's  astonishment and  distress  the wizard 
threw it suddenly  into the middle  of a glowing corner  of the fire.  Frodo 
gave a cry and groped for the tongs; but Gandalf held him back. 
     'Wait!' he said in a commanding voice,  giving Frodo a quick  look from 
under his bristling brows. 
     No apparent  change came over the ring. After a  while  Gandalf got up, 
closed  the shutters outside the window,  and drew  the  curtains.  The room 
became dark and silent, though the  clack of Sam's shears, now nearer to the  
windows,  could  still be heard  faintly from the garden. For  a  moment the 
wizard st ood looking at the fire; then he stooped and  removed  the ring  to 
the hearth with the tongs, and at once picked it up. Frodo gasped. 
     It  is quite cool,' said Gandalf. 'Take it!' Frodo received  it  on his 
shrinking palm: it seemed to have become thicker and heavier than ever. 
     'Hold it up!' said Gandalf. 'And look closely!' 
     As  Frodo  did  so,  he  now  saw  fine  lines, finer than  the  finest  
pen-strokes,  running along the ring, outside and inside: lines of fire that 

####-seemed  to  form  the  letters of a flowing  script. They  shone  piercingly 
bright, and yet remote, as if out of a great depth. 
 
     I cannot read the fiery letters,' said Frodo in a quavering voice. 
     'No,' said Gandalf, 'but I can. The  letters are Elvish,  of an ancient 
mode, but the  language is that of Mordor, which I will  not utter here. But 
this in the Common Tongue is what is said, close enough: 
     One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, 
     One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them. 
     It is only two lines of a verse long known in Elven-lore: 
     Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky, 
     Seven for the Dwarf- lords in their halls of stone, 
     Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die, 
     One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne 
     In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie. 
     One Ring to rule them all. One Ring to find them, 
     One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them 
     In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.' 
     He  paused,  and  then  said  slowly in  a  deep voice:  'This  is  the 
Master-ring, the One  Ring to rule them all.  This is the  One  Ring that he 
lost many ages ago, to the great weakening of  his power. He greatly desires 
it - but he must not get it.' 
     Frodo sat silent  and motionless.  Fear seemed  to stretch out  a  vast  
hand, like a dark  cloud rising in the East and  looming  up  to engulf him. 
'This ring!' he stammered. 'How, how on earth did it come to me?' 
     'Ah!' said Gandalf. 'That is a very long story. The beginnings lie back 
in  the Black Years, which only the lore-masters now remember. If  I were to 
tell  you all  that tale, we should still  be sitting  here when  Spring had 
passed into Winter. 
     'But last  night  I told  you of Sauron the Great,  the Dark  Lord. The 
rumours that you have  heard are  true: he  has indeed arisen again and left 
his hold in Mirkwood and returned to his ancient fastness in the  Dark Tower 
of Mordor. That name even  you  hobbits have heard of, like a  shadow on the 
borders of  old  stories. Always after a  defeat and a  respite, the  Shadow 
takes another shape and grows again.' 
     'I wish it need not have happened in my time,' said Frodo. 
     'So do I,' said Gandalf, 'and so do all who live to see such times. But 

####-that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the 
time that  is given, us. And already, Frodo,  our  time is beginning to look  
black. The Enemy is fast becoming very strong. His plans are  far from ripe,  
I think, but  they are ripening. We shall be hard put to  it.  We  should be 
very hard put to it, even if it were not for this dreadful chance. 
     'The Enemy  still lacks one thing to give him strength and knowledge to 
beat down all resistance,  break the last defences, and cover  all the lands 
in a second darkness. He lacks the One Ring. 
     'The  Three, fairest of all, the Elf-lords hid  from him, and  his hand 
never touched  them or  sullied them. Seven the  Dwarf-kings possessed,  but 
three he  has recovered,  and the others the  dragons have consumed. Nine he 
gave  to  Mortal Men,  proud and great, and so ensnared them. Long ago  they 
fell under  the dominion  of the One, and they became  Ringwraiths,  shadows 
under  his  great Shadow, his most terrible servants. Long ago. It is many a  
year since the Nine walked abroad. Yet who  knows?  As the Shadow grows 
once 
more, they too may walk again. But  come!  We will not speak of such  things 
even in the morning of the Shire. 
     'So it is now: the Nine he has gathered to himself; the Seven also,  or  
else  they are  destroyed.  The Three are hidden still.  But that no  longer  
troubles him. He only  needs the One; for he made  that Ring himself, it  is 
his, and he let a great part of his  own former power pass  into it, so that 
he could rule all the other s.  If he recovers it, then he  will command them 
all again, wherever they be,  even the Three, and  all that has been wrought 
with them will be laid bare, and he will be stronger than ever. 
     'And this  is the dreadful chance, Frodo. He believed that the  One had 
perished; that the Elves had destroyed it, as should have been  done. But he 
knows now that it has not perished, that it has been found. So he is seeking 
it, seeking it, and all his thought is bent  on it. It is his great hope and 
our great fear. ' 
     'Why,  why wasn't it destroyed?'  cried Frodo. 'And how  did  the Enemy  
ever come to lose it, if  he  was so strong, and it was so precious to him?' 
He  clutched  the Ring  in his hand,  as  if  he saw  already  dark  fingers 
stretching out to seize it. 
     'It  was taken from him,' said Gandalf.  'The  strength of the Elves to 
resist  him was greater long ago; and  not all Men were estranged from them. 
The  Men of Westernesse  came  to their aid. That  is a  chapter of  ancient 

####-history which it might be good to recall; for there was sorrow then too, and 
gathering dark, but great valour, and great deeds that were not wholly vain. 
One day, perhaps, I will tell you all the tale, or you shall hear it told in 
full by one who knows it best. 
     'But for the moment, since most of all you need to know how  this thing 
came to  you, and that will be tale enough, this is all that  I will say. It 
was Gil-galad,  Elven-king and Elendil  of Westernesse who overthrew Sauron, 
though they themselves perished in the  deed; and Isildur Elendil's son  cut 
the  Ring  from  Sauron's hand and  took  it  for his own.  Then  Sauron was 
vanquished  and  his  spirit fled and was hidden for long  years,  until his 
shadow took shape again in Mirkwood. 
     'But  the  Ring was  lost. It fell  into  the Great  River, Anduin,  and 
vanished. For Isildur was marching north  along the east banks of the River,  
and near the Gladden Fields he was waylaid by the Orcs of the Mountains, and 
almost all his folk  were slain. He leaped  into the waters,  but  the  Ring 
slipped from his finger as he swam, and then the Orcs saw him and killed him 
with arrows.' 
     Gandalf paused. 'And there in the dark pools amid the  Gladden Fields,' 
he said, 'the Ring passed out  of knowledge and legend; and even so much  of 
its history is known now  only to a few, and the Council of the  Wise  could 
discover no more. But at last I can carry on the story, I think. 
     'Long  after, but  still very long ago, there lived by the banks of the 
Great River  on  the edge of  Wilderland  a  clever -handed  and quiet-footed 
little people. I guess they were of hobbit-kind; akin to the fathers of  the 
fathers  of the Stoors, for they loved  the  River, and often swam in it, or  
made  little  boats  of reeds. There was among them a family of high repute,  
for it was  large and wealthier than most, and it was ruled by a grandmother  
of  the  folk, stern  and  wise  in old lore,  such  as they  had. The  most 
inquisitive and  curious-minded of that  family was called  Smjagol. He  was 
interested in  roots and beginnings; he dived into  deep pools; he  burrowed 
under  trees and  growing plants; he tunnelled  into green  mounds;  and  he 
ceased to  look up at the hill -tops, or the leaves on trees, or  the flowers 
opening in the air: his head and his eyes were downward. 
     'He had a  friend  called Djagol, of similar sort, sharper -eyed but not 
so quick and strong. On a time they took a boat and went down to the Gladden 
Fields, where  there were  great beds  of  iris  and  flowering reeds. There 
Smjagol got out and went nosing about the banks but Deal sat in the boat and 

####-fished. Suddenly a great fish took  his  hook, and before he  knew where  he 
was, he was dragged out and down into the water, to  the bottom. Then he let 
go of his line, for he thought he saw  something shining  in  the river -bed; 
and holding his breath he grabbed at it. 
     'Then up he came spluttering,  with weeds in his  hair and a handful of 
mud; and he swam to the bank. And behold! when he washed the mud away, 
there 
in his  hand lay a beautiful golden ring; and it  shone and glittered in the 
sun, so  that his heart  was glad.  But  Smjagol had  been watching him from 
behind  a tree, and as Deal  gloated  over the  ring, Smjagol came softly up 
behind. 
     '"Give  us  that,  Deal,  my  love,"  said Smjagol,  over  his friend's 
shoulder. 
     '"Why?" said Deal. 
     ' "Because it's my birthday, my love, and I wants it," said Smjagol. 
     '"I don't care," said Deal. "I have  given  you a present already, more 
than I could afford. I found this, and I'm going to keep it." 
     ' "Oh, are you  indeed, my  love," said  Smjagol; and he caught Deal by 
the  throat  and  strangled  him,  because  the gold  looked  so bright  and 
beautiful. Then he put the ring on his finger. 
     'No one  ever found out what had become  of  Deal;  he was murdered far  
from home, and  his body  was cunningly hidden. But  Smjagol returned alone; 
and he found that none of his  family could see him, when he was wearing the 
ring. He was  very  pleased with  his discovery  and he concealed it; and he 
used it  to  find  out secrets, and  he  put  his  knowledge to crooked  and 
malicious  uses.  He became  sharp-eyed and  keen-eared  for  all  that  was 
hurtful. The ring had given him power according to  his stature. It is not to 
be wondered at  that he became very unpopular and was shunned (when 
visible)  
by  all his  relations.  They kicked him, and he  bit their feet. He took to 
thieving, and going about muttering to himself,  and gurgling in his throat. 
So they called him Gollum, and cursed him, and told him to go far  away; and 
his grandmother, desiring peace, expelled him from the family and turned him 
out of her hole. 
     'He wandered in  loneliness, weeping a little for the  hardness  of the 
world, and he journeyed up the River, till  he came to a stream that  flowed 
down from the mountains, and he went that way.  He caught fish in deep pools 

####-with invisible fingers and ate them raw. One day it was very hot, and as  he 
was  bending over a  pool, he felt a burning  on the back of his head) and a  
dazzling light from the water pained his wet eyes. He wondered at it, for he 
had almost forgotten about  the Sun. Then for the last time he looked up and 
shook his fist at her. 
     'But  as  he  lowered his eyes, he saw far above  the tops of the Misty 
Mountains, out of which the stream came.  And he thought suddenly: "It would 
be cool and shady under  those mountains. The Sun could not  watch me there. 
The  roots  of those mountains  must be  roots indeed; there  must be  great 
secrets buried there which have not been discovered since the beginning." 
     'So he journeyed by night up into  the highlands, and he found a little 
cave  out of which the dark stream ran; and  he wormed his way like a maggot 
into the heart of the  hills, and vanished  out  of all  knowledge. The Ring 
went into the shadows with him, and even the maker, when his power had 
begun 
to grow again, could learn nothing of it.' 
     'Gollum!' cried  Frodo. 'Gollum? Do  you mean  that this  is  the  very 
Gollum-creature that Bilbo met? How loathsome!' 
     'I  think  it  is  a sad  story,' said the  wizard, 'and it might  have 
happened to others, even to some hobbits that I have known.' 
     'I  can't  believe  that  Gollum  was  connected with  hobbits, however 
distantly,' said Frodo with some heat. 'What an abominable notion!' 
     'It is  true all  the same,' replied Gandalf. 'About their  origins, at 
any  rate, I know  more than hobbits  do themselves. And even  Bilbo's story 
suggests the kinship. There  was  a  great  deal in the background  of their 
minds  and memories  that was  very  similar.  They  understood one  another 
remarkably well,  very much  better  than a hobbit would  understand, say, a  
Dwarf, or an Orc, or even  an Elf. Think of the riddles they both  knew, for  
one thing.' 
     'Yes,' said Frodo. 'Though other folks besides hobbits ask riddles, and 
of  much the same sort. And hobbits don't cheat.  Gollum  meant to cheat all  
the time. He was just trying to put poor Bilbo  off his  guard. And I daresay 
it amused his wickedness  to  start a game which might end  in providing him 
with an easy victim, but if he lost would not hurt him.' 
     'Only too true, I fear,' said Gandalf. 'But there was something else in 
it, I think, which you don't see yet. Even Gollum was not wholly  ruined. He 
had proved tougher than even one of the Wise would have guessed  -as a hobbit 

####-might. There  was a little  corner of  his mind that was still  his own, and 
light  came  through it, as  through  a  chink in the dark: light out of the 
past.  It was actually  pleasant,  I think,  to  hear  a kindly voice again, 
bringing up memories  of wind,  and trees, and sun  on the  grass, and  such 
forgotten things.  
     'But that, of  course, would only make the evil  part of him angrier in 
the end - unless it could  be conquered.  Unless it could be cured.' Gandalf 
sighed. 'Alas! there is little hope of  that for him. Yet  not  no hope. No, 
not  though  he  possessed  the Ring so  long, almost  as far back as he can 
remember. For it was long since he  had worn it much:  in the black darkness 
it was seldom needed. Certainly he had never "faded".  He is  thin and tough 
still. But the  thing was eating up his mind, of course, and the torment had 
become almost unbearable. 
     'All the "great secrets" under the mountains had turned  out to be just  
empty night: there was  nothing more to find out,  nothing worth doing, only 
nasty furtive eating and resentful remembering.  He was altogether wretched. 
He hated the  dark,  and  he hated light more: he hated  everything, and the 
Ring most of all.' 
     'What  do you mean?' said Frodo. 'Surely the Ring was his  precious and 
the only thing he cared for?  But if he  hated it,  why didn't he get rid of 
it, or go away and leave it?' 
     'You  ought to  begin to understand, Frodo,  after all you have heard,' 
said Gandalf. 'He  hated it and loved it, as he hated and loved  himself. He 
could not get rid of it. He had no will left in the matter. 
     'A  Ring  of  Power  looks   after  itself,  Frodo.  It  may  slip  off 
treacherously, but its keeper never  abandons it. At most he  plays with the 
idea of handing  it on  to someone else's care  - and  that  only at an early 
stage, when it first  begins  to grip. But  as  far as I know Bilbo alone in 
history has ever gone beyond playing, and  really done it.  He needed all my 
help, too. And even  so he would never  have just  forsaken  it, or  cast it 
aside. It  was not Gollum, Frodo, but the  Ring  itself that decided things.  
The Ring left him.' 
     'What, just in time  to meet Bilbo?' said Frodo. 'Wouldn't an  Orc have 
suited it better?' 
     'It  is no laughing  matter,'  said Gandalf. 'Not for you.  It was  the 
strangest event in the  whole history of the  Ring so far:  Bilbo's  arrival 
just at that time, and putting his hand on it, blindly, in the dark. 

####-     'There was more than one power at work, Frodo. The  Ring was  trying to 
get back to its master. It had slipped from Isildur's hand and betrayed him; 
then when a  chance came it caught poor Deal, and he was murdered; and after  
that Gollum,  and it had devoured him. It could make  no further use of him:  
he was too  small and mean; and as long as it stayed with him he would never  
leave his deep pool again. So  now, when its master was awake  once more and 
sending out his dark  thought from Mirkwood, it abandoned Gollum. Only to 
be 
picked up by the most unlikely person imaginable: Bilbo from the Shire!  
     'Behind that there was something else at work, beyond any design of the 
Ring-maker.  I can put it no plainer than by saying that Bilbo was meant  to 
find the Ring, and not by its maker.  In which  case you  also were meant to 
have it. And that maybe an encouraging thought.' 
     It  is  not,' said Frodo. "Though I am not sure  that I understand you. 
But how have you  learned all this about the Ring, and about  Gollum? Do you  
really know it all, or are you just guessing still?' 
     Gandalf looked  at Frodo, and his eyes glinted. I knew much  and I have 
learned much,' he answered. 'But I am not  going to give an account of all my 
doings to you. The history of Elendil and Isildur and the One Ring is  known  
to all the  Wise. Your ring is shown to be that One Ring by the fire-writing 
alone, apart from any  other evidence.' 'And  when  did you discover  that?' 
asked Frodo, interrupting. 'Just  now in this room, of course,' answered the 
wizard sharply.  'But  I expected to  find  it.  I have come back  from dark 
journeys and long search to make that final test. It is the last proof,  and 
all is now only too clear. Making out Gollum's part, and fitting it into the 
gap in the history, required some  thought. I may have  started with guesses 
about Gollum, but I am not guessing now. I know. I have seen him.' 
     'You have seen Gollum?' exclaimed Frodo in amazement. 
     'Yes. The obvious thing to do, of  course, if  one  could. I tried long 
ago; but I have managed it at last.' 
     'Then what happened after Bilbo escaped from him? Do you know that?' 
     'Not so  clearly.  What I  have told you is what Gollum was  willing to 
tell - though not, of course, in the  way  I have  reported it. Gollum  is a  
liar,  and you have to sift his words. For instance, he called the  Ring his 
"birthday  present",  and he  stuck  to  that.  He  said it  came  from  his 
grandmother, who  had lots  of beautiful  things of  that kind. A ridiculous 
story. I have no doubt  that Smjagol's grandmother was a matriarch,  a great 

####-person in her  way,  but to talk of  her  possessing  many  Elven-rings  was 
absurd, and as for giving them away, it was a lie. But a lie with a grain of 
truth. 
     'The  murder  of  Deal haunted  Gollum,  and he had made  up a defence, 
repeating  it  to his "precious" over and  over again, as he gnawed bones in 
the dark, until he almost  believed it. It  was   his birthday. Deal ought to 
have given the ring to him. It had  previously turned up  just so as to be a  
present. It was his birthday present, and so on, and on. 
     I  endured  him  as long  as  I could,  but  the truth  was desperately 
important, and in the end I  had to be harsh. I put the fear of fire on him, 
and wrung  the  true  story  out of  him, bit by  bit,  together  with  much 
snivelling  and snarling. He thought  he was misunderstood and ill-used. But 
when  he  had  at  last  told  me his history,  as  far  as  the end of  the 
Riddle-game  and Bilbo's escape, he would not say any more,  except in  dark 
hints. Some other fear was on him greater than mine. He muttered that he was 
going  to gel his own back. People would see if he would stand being kicked, 
and driven  into  a hole and  then robbed. Gollum had good friends now, good 
friends and very strong. They would help him. Baggins would pay for it. That 
was his chief thought. He hated Bilbo and cursed his name. What  is more, he 
knew where he came from.' 
     'But how did he find that out?' asked Frodo. 
     'Well, as for the  name, Bilbo very foolishly told  Gollum himself; and 
after that  it  would  not be difficult to discover his country, once Gollum 
came out. Oh yes, he came out. His longing for the Ring proved stronger than 
his fear of the Orcs, or even of the light. After a year  or two he left the 
mountains. You  see, though  still  bound  by desire of it, the Ring was  no 
longer devouring him; he began  to revive a little.  He  felt  old , terribly 
old, yet less timid, and he was mortally hungry. 
     'Light, light of Sun and Moon, he still feared and hated, and he always 
will, I think; but he was cunning. He found he could hide  from daylight and 
moonshine,  and make his way swiftly  and softly by dead of night  with  his 
pale cold  eyes,  and  catch  small  frightened or  unwary  things. He  grew 
stronger  and  bolder  with new food  and  new air. He  found  his way  into 
Mirkwood, as one would expect.' 
     'Is that where you found him?' asked Frodo. 
     'I  saw  him there,' answered Gandalf, 'but before that he had wandered 
far, following  Bilbo's trail. It was difficult to  learn anything  from him 

####-for certain, for his talk was constantly interrupted  by curses and threats.  
"What had it  got in its pocketses?" he said. "It wouldn't say, no precious. 
Little cheat. Not a fair  question. It  cheated first, it did. It  broke the 
rules. We ought to have squeezed it, yes precious. And we will, precious!" 
     'That is a sample of his talk. I don't suppose you want any more. I had 
weary days  of it. But from hints dropped among  the snarls I  even gathered 
that his padding feet had  taken him  at last to Esgaroth, and even  to  the 
streets of Dale, listening secretly and peering. Well, the news of the great 
events went far and wide in Wilderland, and many had heard Bilbo's name  and 
knew where he came from.  We had made no secret of our return journey to his 
home in the West. Gollum's sharp ears would soon learn what he wanted.' 
     'Then why didn't  he track Bilbo further?' asked Frodo. 'Why didn't  he 
come to the Shire?' 
     'Ah,' said Gandalf, 'now we come to it. I think Gollum tried to. He set 
out and  came  back westward, as far as the Great River. But  then he turned 
aside. He  was not daunted by  the distance, I am  sure.  No, something else 
drew him away. So my friends think, those that hunted him for me. 
     'The Wood-elves tracked him first, an easy task for them, for his trail 
was  still fresh  then. Through Mirkwood and back again it  led them, though 
they never  caught him. The wood was full of  the  rumour  of  him, dreadful 
tales even among beasts and birds. The  Woodmen said that there was some 
new 
terror abroad, a ghost that drank blood. It climbed trees to  find nests; it 
crept into  holes  to  find  the young; it slipped  through windows  to find 
cradles. 
     'But at the western edge of Mirkwood the trail turned away. It wandered 
off southwards and passed out of the Wood-elves' ken, and was lost. And then 
I made a great mistake. Yes,  Frodo, and not the first; though I fear it may 
prove the  worst. I let the matter be. I let  him go; for I had much else to 
think of at that time, and I still trusted the lore of Saruman. 
     'Well, that was  years ago. I have paid for it since with many dark and 
dangerous days. The trail was long cold when I took it up again, after Bilbo 
left here. And my search would  have been in vain,  but for the  help that I 
had from a friend: Aragorn, the greatest traveller and huntsman of this  age 
of  the world.  Together we  sought  for  Gollum down  the  whole length  of 
Wilderland, without hope, and without success. But at last, when I had given 
up the chase and turned to other parts, Gollum was found. My friend returned 

####-out of the great perils bringing the miserable creature with him. 
     'What he had  been doing  he would not say. He only wept and  called us 
cruel,  with many a gollum in his throat; and when we pressed him he  whined 
and  cringed, and  rubbed his  long hands, licking his  fingers  as if  they 
pained  him, as if he remembered some old torture.  But I am afraid there is 
no possible doubt: he had made his slow, sneaking way, step by step, mile by 
mile, south, down at last to the Land of Mordor.' 
     A heavy silence fell in the room.  Frodo could hear his  heart beating. 
Even outside everything seemed still. No sound of Sam's  shears could now be 
heard. 
     'Yes,  to Mordor,' said Gandalf. 'Alas! Mordor draws all wicked things,  
and the Dark Power was bending all its will to  gather them there.  The Ring 
of the Enemy would leave  its  mark, too, leave him open to the summons. And 
all folk were whispering then of the new Shadow in the South, and its hatred  
of  the  West.  There were his fine  new  friends, who would help him in his 
revenge!  
     'Wretched  fool!  In that land he  would  learn  much, too much for his 
comfort. And sooner or later as he lurked and pried on  the borders he would  
be caught, and taken - for examination. That was the way of it, I fear. When 
he was found he  had already been  there long,  and was on his  way back. On 
some errand  of  mischief. But  that  does  not matter  much now. His  worst  
mischief was done. 
     'Yes, alas! through  him the  Enemy has learned that the One  has  been 
found again. He  knows where Isildur fell. He knows  where  Gollum found his 
ring. He knows that it is a Great Ring, for it gave long life. He knows that 
it is not one of the  Three, for they have  never been lost, and they endure 
no evil. He knows that it is not one of the Seven, or the Nine, for they are 
accounted for.  He  knows that it is  the One.  And he has  at last heard, I 
think, of hobbits and the Shire. 
     'The Shire - he may be seeking for  it now, if he has not already found 
out where it lies. Indeed, Frodo, I fear that  he may  even think  that  the 
long-unnoticed name of Baggins has become important.' 
     'But this is  terrible!' cried Frodo. 'Far  worse than the worst that I 
imagined from your hints and warnings. O Gandalf, best of friends, what am I 
to do? For now I am really afraid. What  am  I to do? What a pity that Bilbo  
did not stab that vile creature, when he had a chance!' 
     'Pity? It was Pity that stayed his hand. Pity, and Mercy: not to strike 

####-without need. And  he has been well rewarded, Frodo. Be sure that he took so 
little hurt from the evil,  and escaped  in  the  end, because he began  his 
ownership of the Ring so. With Pity.' 
     'I am sorry,' said  Frodo.  'But I am frightened; and I do not feel any 
pity for Gollum.' 
     'You have not seen him,' Gandalf broke in. 
     'No,  and I don't  want to,' said Frodo. I can't understand you. Do you  
mean to  say that you, and the Elves, have let him live on  after all  those 
horrible  deeds? Now at any rate he is  as bad as an Orc, and just an enemy. 
He deserves death.' 
     'Deserves it! I daresay he does. Many that live deserve death. And some 
that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager  to 
deal out death in judgement.  For  even the very wise cannot see all ends. I 
have not much hope  that Gollum can be cured before  he dies, but there is a  
chance of it. And  he is bound  up with the fate of the Ring. My heart tells 
me that  he  has some part to play yet, for good or ill, before the end; and 
when that comes, the pity  of Bilbo may  rule the fate  of many -  yours not 
least. In any case we did  not kill him:  he is very old  and very wretched. 
The Wood-elves have him in prison, but they treat him with such  kindness as 
they can find in their wise hearts.' 
     'All the same,' said Frodo,  'even if  Bilbo could  not kill  Gollum, I 
wish he had not kept the  Ring. I wish he had never found it, and that I had 
not got it!  Why  did  you  let me keep it? Why didn't you make me  throw it  
away, or, or destroy it?' 
     'Let you? Make you?' sa id the  wizard.  'Haven't you been  listening to 
all  that I  have said? You are not thinking of what you are saying.  But as 
for throwing  it away,  that was  obviously wrong. These Rings have a way of 
being  found. In evil hands it might have done great evil. Worst  of all, it 
might have fallen into the  hands of the Enemy. Indeed  it certainly  would; 
for this is the One, and  he is exerting all his power to find it or draw it 
to himself. 
     'Of  course, my  dear  Frodo,  it  was dangerous  for you; and that has 
troubled me deeply. But there  was so  much at stake that I had to take some 
risk  - though even when  I was far away there has never been a day when the 
Shire has not been guarded by watchful eyes. As long as you never used it, I  
did not think  that the Ring would have  any lasting effect on  you, not for 
evil,  not at any rate for a very long time. And you must remember that nine 

####-years ago, when I last saw you, I still knew little for certain.' 
     'But  why  not destroy  it, as you say should have been done long ago?' 
cried Frodo again. If you had warned me, or even  sent me a message, I would 
have done away with it.' 
     'Would you? How would you do that? Have you ever tried?' 
     'No. But I suppose one could hammer it or melt it.' 
     'Try!' said Gandalf. Try now!' 
     Frodo drew the Ring  out of his pocket again and looked  at it. It  now 
appeared  plain and smooth, without  mark or device that  he  could see. The 
gold looked very fair and pure, and Frodo thought how rich and beautiful was 
its  colour,  how perfect was  its  roundness. It was an admirable thing and 
altogether  precious. When he  took  it out he had intended to fling it from 
him into the very hottest  part of the  fire. But he found now that he could 
not do so, not without a great  struggle. He weighed the  Ring in his  hand, 
hesitating,  and forcing himself to remember all that Gandalf had told  him; 
and then with an effort of will he made a movement, as if to cast  it away - 
but he found that he had put it back in his pocket. 
     Gandalf laughed grimly. 'You see? Already you too, Frodo, cannot easily 
let  it  go,  nor will to damage it. And I  could not "make" you - except by 
force, which would break your mind. But as for breaking  the Ring, force  is 
useless. Even if you  took it and struck it  with a  heavy sledge -hammer,  it 
would make no dint in it. It cannot be unmade by your hands, or by mine. 
     'Your small  fire, of course, would  not melt even ordinary  gold. This 
Ring has already passed through it unscathed,  and even unheated.  But there 
is  no smith's forge in this Shire that could change it at all. Not even the 
anvils and furnaces  of  the Dwarves could do that.  It has been  said  that 
dragon-fire could melt and consume the Rings  of Power, but there is not now 
any dragon left on earth in which the old fire is hot enough; nor was  there 
ever any dragon, not even Ancalagon the Black, who could have harmed the 
One 
Ring,  the Ruling Ring, for  that was  made by Sauron himself. There is only 
one  way:  to  find  the  Cracks  of Doom in  the  depths  of Orodruin,  the 
Fire-mountain, and cast the Ring in there, if you really wish to destroy it, 
to put it beyond the grasp of the Enemy for ever.' 
     'I do  really wish to destroy it!'  cried Frodo. 'Or,  well, to have it 
destroyed. I am not  made for perilous  quests. I wish  I had never seen the 
Ring! Why did it come to me? Why was I chosen?' 

####-     'Such questions cannot be  answered,'  said Gandalf.  'You may be  sure 
that it was not  for any merit that others do not possess: not for  power or  
wisdom,  at any rate. But you have been chosen, and you  must therefore  use 
such strength and heart and wits as you have.' 
     'But I  have so  little of any  of  these  things!  You  are  wise  and 
powerful. Will you not take the Ring?' 
     'No!' cried Gandalf, springing  to  his feet. 'With that power I should 
have power too great and terrible. And over me the Ring  would  gain a power  
still greater and more deadly.' His eyes flashed and his face  was lit as by 
a fire within.  'Do not tempt me! For I do not  wish to become like the  Dark 
Lord  himself. Yet the  way of the  Ring  to  my heart is by pity, pity  for  
weakness and the desire of strength to do good. Do  not tempt me! I dare not  
take it, not even to keep it safe, unused. The wish to wield it would be too 
great, for my  strength.  I shall  have  such  need of it. Great  perils lie 
before me.' 
     He  went to the  window and drew aside the curtains  and the  shutters.  
Sunlight  streamed  back again into  the  room. Sam   passed  along the  path  
outside whistling. 'And now,'  said  the wizard, turning back to Frodo, 'the 
decision lies with you. But  I will always  help you.' He  laid his hand  on 
Frodo's shoulder. 'I will help you bear this  burden, as long as It is yours 
to bear. But we must do something, soon. The Enemy is moving.' 
     There was a long  silence.  Gandalf  sat down again and puffed  at  his 
pipe, as if lost in thought. His eyes  seemed closed, but under the  lids he 
was watching Frodo  intently. Frodo  gazed fixedly at the red embers on  the 
hearth,  until they filled all his vision,  and he seemed to be looking down 
into  profound  wells of fire. He was thinking of the fabled  Cracks of Doom 
and the terror of the Fiery Mountain. 
     'Well!'  said Gandalf at last.  'What are you  thinking about? Have you  
decided what to do?' 
     'No!'  answered Frodo,  coming back to himself  out  of  darkness,  and 
finding to his surprise that it was not dark, and that out of the  window he 
could see the sunlit garden.   'Or perhaps, yes.  As far as I understand what 
you have said, I suppose I must keep the Ring and guard it, at least for the 
present, whatever it may do to me.' 
     'Whatever it may do, it will be slow, slow to evil, if you keep it with 
that purpose,' said  Gandalf.  
     'I hope so,'  said Frodo.  'But I  hope  that  you may  find some other  

####-better  keeper soon. But in the meanwhile it  seems that I  am  a  danger, a  
danger  to all that live near  me.  I cannot  keep the Ring and stay here. I 
ought to leave   Bag End,  leave the Shire, leave everything and go away.' He 
sighed. 
     'I should like to  save  the Shire, if I could  - though there have been 
times when I thought the inhabitants too stupid and dull for words, and have 
felt that an earthquake or  an invasion of dragons might  be good  for them. 
But  I don't feel  like that  now. I feel  that  as  long as the Shire  lies 
behind, safe and comfortable, I shall find  wandering more bearable: I shall 
know that somewhere there is a firm  foothold, even if my feet  cannot stand 
there again. 
     'Of course, I have sometimes thought of going away, but I imagined that 
as a kind of holiday, a series of adventures like Bilbo's  or better, ending 
in  peace. But this  would  mean exile,  a  flight from danger into  danger, 
drawing  it after me. And I suppose I  must go alone, if I am to do that and 
save  the Shire.  But I  feel very  small, and  very  uprooted,  and  well - 
desperate. The Enemy is so strong and terrible.' 
     He did  not tell  Gandalf, but as  he  was speaking a  great desire  to 
follow  Bilbo flamed up in his heart  - to follow Bilbo, and even perhaps  to 
find him again. It was so strong that it overcame his fear: he  could almost  
have run out there and then down the road without his hat, as Bilbo ha d done 
on a similar morning long ago. 
     'My  dear  Frodo!'  exclaimed  Gandalf.  'Hobbits  really  are  amazing 
creatures, as I have said before. You  can learn all that there  is  to know 
about their  ways in a month, and yet after  a hundred  years they can still 
surprise you at a pinch. I hardly expected to get  such  an answer, not even 
from  you. But Bilbo made no mistake in choosing his heir, though  he little 
thought how important it  would prove. I am afraid  you are  right. The Ring 
will not be able to stay hidden in the  Shire much longer; and for  your own 
sake, as  well  as  for others, you  will have to go, and leave the  name of 
Baggins behind you. That name will not be safe to have, outside the Shire or  
in the Wild. I will give  you a travelling name now. When you go, go as  Mr. 
Underhill. 
     'But I don't think you need go alone. Not if you know of anyone you can 
trust, and who would be willing  to go by your side  -  and that you would be 
willing to take  into unknown perils.  But  if you look for a  companion, be 
careful in choosing! And be  careful of what  you say,  even to your closest  

####-friends! The enemy has many spies and many ways of hearing.' 
     Suddenly he  stopped as if  listening.  Frodo became aware that all was 
very quiet,  inside and  outside. Gandalf  crept to one side of  the window.  
Then with  a  dart he  sprang to  the sill,  and thrust a  long arm out  and 
downwards. There was a squawk, and up came Sam Gamgee's curly head 
hauled by 
one ear. 
     'Well, well, bless my beard!' said Gandalf. 'Sam Gamgee is it? Now what 
may you be doing?' 
     'Lor bless  you, Mr. Gandalf, sir!' said Sam. 'Nothing! Leastways I was 
just  trimming the grass-border  under  the window,  if you  follow me.'  He 
picked up his shears and exhibited them as evidence. 
     'I don't,' said Gandalf grimly. It is some time  since I last heard the 
sound of your shears. How long have you been eavesdropping?' 
     'Eavesdropping,  sir? I don't  follow you, begging  your pardon.  There 
ain't no eaves at Bag End, and that's a fact.' 
     'Don't be  a  fool! What  have  you  heard,  and why  did you  listen?' 
Gandalf's eyes flashed and his brows stuck out like bristles.  
     'Mr. Frodo, sir!' cried Sam quaking. 'Don't let him hurt me, sir! Don't  
let  him turn  me  into anything unnatural!  My old  dad would take on so. I 
meant no harm, on my honour, sir!' 
     'He  won't hurt you,' said Frodo,  hardly able to keep  from  laughing, 
although he was himself startled and rather puzzled. 'He knows, as well as I  
do, that you mean no harm. But just you up and answer his questions straight 
away!' 
     'Well, sir,' said Sam dithering a little. 'I heard a deal that I didn't 
rightly  understand,  about an  enemy, and  rings, and  Mr. Bilbo, sir,  and 
dragons, and a  fiery mountain, and - and  Elves, sir. I listened because  I 
couldn't help  myself, if you know what I mean. Lor bless  me, sir, but I do 
love tales of  that sort. And  I believe  them  too,  whatever Ted may  say. 
Elves,  sir! I  would dearly love  to see  them. Cou ldn't you take  me to see 
Elves, sir, when you go?' 
     Suddenly Gandalf laughed. 'Come  inside!' he shouted,  and  putting out 
both his arms he lifted the astonished Sam, shears, grass-clippings and all, 
right through the window and stood him on the floor. 'Take you to see Elves, 
eh?' he  said, eyeing Sam  closely, but with a smile flickering on his face. 
'So you heard that Mr. Frodo is going away?' 

####-     'I  did,  sir.  And that's why I choked:  which  you heard seemingly. I 
tried not to, sir, but it burst out of me: I was so upset.' 
     'It can't be  helped, Sam,' said  Frodo sadly. He had suddenly realized 
that  flying  from the Shire  would mean  more painful partings than  merely 
saying farewell  to  the familiar comforts of Bag End. 'I shall have to  go. 
But' - and  here he looked  hard at Sam  - 'if you really care about me, you  
will keep that dead secret. See? If you don't, if you even breathe a word of 
what you've heard here, then  I  hope  Gandalf will turn you into a  spotted 
toad and fill the garden full of grass-snakes.' 
     Sam fell on his knees,  trembling. 'Get  up, Sam!' said Gandalf. I have 
thought of something better than  that. Something  to shut your  mouth,  and  
punish you properly for listening. You shall go away with Mr. Frodo!' 
     'Me,  sir!' cried Sam, springing up like a dog invited for a walk.  'Me 
go and see Elves and all! Hooray!' he shouted, and then burst into tears.  
 

####- 

Chapter 3. Three is Company 

 
 
     'You ought to go quietly, and you ought to  go soon,' said Gandalf. Two 
or three weeks had passed, and still Frodo made  no sign of getting ready to 
go. 
     'I know. But it is difficult to do both,' he objected. If I just vanish 
like Bilbo, the tale will be all over the Shire in no time.' 
     'Of course you mustn't vanish!' said Gandalf. 'That wouldn't do at all! 
I said soon, not instantly. If  you can think of any way of slipping out  of 
the  Shire  without  its  being generally known, it will  be  worth a little 
delay. But you must not delay too long.' 
     'What  about the  autumn, on  or after  Our Birthday?' asked  Frodo. 'I  
think I could probably make some arrangements by then.' 
     To tell the truth, he was very reluctant to start, now that it had come 
to  the  point. Bag End seemed a more  desirable residence than  i t  had for 
years, and he wanted to savour as much as he could of his last summer in the 
Shire. When autumn came, he knew that part at least of his heart would think 
more kindly  of journeying, as it always did at that season. He  had  indeed 
privately made up his mind to leave on his  fiftieth birthday:  Bilbo's  one 
hundred and twenty-eighth. It  seemed somehow the proper day on which to set 
out and follow him. Following Bilbo was uppermost in his mind, and  the  one 
thing  that made the thought  of leaving  bearable. He  thought as little as 
possible about the Ring, and where it might lead him in  the end. But he did 
not tell all his  thoughts to Gandalf. What the  wizard  guessed  was always 
difficult to tell. 
     He looked at Frodo and smiled. 'Very well,' he said. 'I think that will 
do -  but  it must not  be any  later. I  am getting  very anxious.  In  the 
mean-while, do take care, and don't let out any hint of where you are going!  
And  see  that Sam Gamgee does not talk. If he does, I really shall turn him 
into a toad.' 
     'As for  where I am going,' said Frodo, 'it would be  difficult to give 
that away, for I have no clear idea myself, yet.' 
     'Don't be absurd!' said Gandalf. 'I  am not warning you against leaving 
an  address  at the post -office!  But you are leaving the  Shire   - and that 
should not be known,  until you  are far away. And  you must go, or at least 

####-set  out,  either North,  South,  West  or East  -  and  the direction should 
certainly not be known.' 
     'I have been so  taken up with the thoughts of leaving  Bag End, and of 
saying  farewell, that I have  never even  considered  the  direction,' said 
Frodo. 'For where am I to go? And by  what  shall I  steer? What is to be my  
quest? Bilbo went to find a treasure, there and back aga in; but I go to lose 
one, and not return, as far as I can see.' 
     'But you cannot  see very far,' said Gandalf. 'Neither can I. It may be 
your task to find the Cracks of Doom; but that quest may be for others: I do 
not know. At any rate you are not ready for that long road yet.' 
     'No  indeed!' said  Frodo.  'But  in the  meantime what course am I  to 
lake?' 
     'Towards  danger; but not  too  rashly, nor too straight,' answered the 
wizard. 'If you want my advice, make for Rivendell. That journey  should not 
prove too  perilous, though the  Road is less easy than it was, and it  will 
grow worse as the year fails.' 
     'Rivendell!' said  Frodo. 'Very good:  I will go east, and  I will make 
for Rivendell. I will take Sam to visit the Elves; he will be delighted.' He 
spoke lightly;  but his heart was  moved  suddenly with  a desire to see the 
house of Elrond  Halfelven, and  breathe the  air  of that deep valley where 
many of the Fair Folk still dwelt in peace. 
     One summer's evening an astonishing piece of news  reached the Ivy Bush 
and Green Dragon. Giants and other portents on the borders of the Shire were 
forgotten for more important matters: Mr. Frodo was  selling Bag End, indeed 
he had already sold it - to the Sackville-Bagginses!  
     'For a nice bit, loo,' said some.  'At a bargain price,'  said  others,  
'and that's more likely when Mistress Lobelia's  the  buyer.' (Otho had died 
some years before, at the ripe but disappointed age of 102.) 
     Just  why  Mr.  Frodo  was selling  his  beautiful hole was  even  more 
debatable than the price. A  few held the theory - supported by the nods and  
hints  of Mr. Baggins himself  - that Frodo's money was  running out: he  was 
going to leave Hobbiton and live in a  quiet way on the proceeds of the sale 
down  in  Buckland  among   his  Brandybuck  relations.  'As  far  from  the 
Sackville-Bagginses  as may be,'  some added.  But  so firmly fixed  had the 
notion of  the immeasurable wealth  of the Bagginses of Bag End  become that 
most found this  hard to believe, harder than  any  other reason or unreason 
that  their fancy  could suggest:  to  most  it suggested  a  dark  and  yet 

####-unrevealed plot by Gandalf. Though he kept himself very quiet and did not go 
about by day, it was well known that he was 'hiding up in the  Bag End'. But 
however a removal might  fit in with the  designs of his wizardry, there was 
no doubt about the fact: Frodo Baggins was going back to Buckland. 
     'Yes, I shall be moving  this autumn,' he  said.  'Merry Brandybuck  is 
looking out  for a nice little hole for me, or perhaps a small house.' 
     As a matter of fact with  Merry's help he had already chosen and bought 
a little house  at Crickhollow in the country beyond Bucklebury. To all  but 
Sam he pretended he was going to settle down there permanently. The decision 
to set out eastwards had suggested the idea to him; for Buckland was on  the 
eastern borders  of  the Shire, and as he had lived there  in childhood  his 
going back would at least seem credible. 
     Gandalf  stayed in the Shire for over two months.  Then one evening, at 
the end of  June, soon  after Frodo's  plan  had  been finally  arranged, he 
suddenly  announced that  he was going off  again next morning.  'Only for a 
short  while, I hope,'  he said.  'But  I am  going down beyond the southern 
borders to get some news, if I can. I have been idle longer than I should.' 
     He spoke lightly, but it seemed to Frodo that he looked rather worried. 
'Has anything happened?' he asked. 
     'Well no; but I have heard something that has made me anxious and needs 
looking into. If I think it necessary after all  for you to get off at once, 
I shall come back immediately, or at least send word. In the meanwhile stick  
to your plan; but be more careful than ever, especially of the  Ring.  Let me 
impress on you once more: don't use it!'  
     He  went off at dawn.  'I may be back any day,'  he  said. 'At the very 
latest I shall come back  for  the farewell party. I think after all you may 
need my company on the Road.' 
     At first  Frodo  was a  good deal  disturbed,  and wondered often  what 
Gandalf could  have  heard; but his  uneasiness wore  off, and in  the  fine  
weather  he forgot his  troubles for a  while. The  Shire had seldom seen so 
fair a summer, or so rich an autumn: the trees were laden with apples, honey 
was dripping in the combs, and the corn was tall and full. 
     Autumn was well under  way  before  Frodo began to worry  about Gandalf 
again.  September  was  passing  and there  was  still no  news of him.  The 
Birthday, and the removal, drew  nearer, and still he did not come,  or send 
word.  Bag End began to be busy.  Some of Frodo's friends  came  to stay and 
help  him with the packing: there was Fredegar Bolger and Folco  Boffin, and 

####-of course his special friends Pippin Took and Merry Brandybuck. Between 
them 
they turned the whole place upside-down. 
     On  September  20th  two  covered  carts  went off  laden  to Buckland, 
conveying  the furniture and goods that Frodo had not  sold to his new home, 
by way of the  Brandywine Bridge. The next day Frodo became  really anxious, 
and kept  a constant look -out  for  Gandalf. Thursday, his birthday morning,  
dawned as fair and  clear  as it had long ago for Bilbo's great party. Still 
Gandalf did not appear. In the evening Frodo gave his farewell feast: it was 
quite small, just  a  dinner  for himself  and his four helpers; but  he was 
troubled and fell in no mood for it. The thought  that he would so soon have 
to part  with his young  friends weighed  on his heart. He  wondered how  he 
would break it to them. 
     The four younger  hobbits were, however, in high spirits, and the party 
soon became very cheerful in spite of Gandalf's absence. The dining-room was 
bare except for a table  and  chairs,  but the food  was good, and there was 
good  wine:  Frodo's  wine  had  not  been  included  in  the  sale  to  the 
Sackville-Bagginses. 
     'Whatever happens to  the rest of my stuff, when the S.-B.s  get  their 
claws on  it, at any rate I have found a good home for this!' said Frodo, as 
he drained his glass. It was the last drop of Old Winyards.  
     When they had sung many songs, and talked of  many things they had done 
together,  they toasted  Bilbo's birthday, and  they  drank his  health  and 
Frodo's together according to Frodo's custom. Then they went out for a sniff 
of air, and glimpse of the stars, and then  they went to bed.  Frodo's party 
was over, and Gandalf had not come. 
     The next morning they were busy packing another cart with the remainder 
of the luggage. Merry took charge of this, and drove off with Fatty (that is 
Fredegar  Bolger).  'Someone must get there and  warm the house  before  you  
arrive,' said Merry.  'Well, see you later - the day  after tomorrow,  if you  
don't go to sleep on the way!' 
     Folco went  home  aft er lunch,  but Pippin remained behind.  Frodo  was 
restless and anxious,  listening in vain for a  sound of Gandalf. He decided 
to  wait until  nightfall. After that,  if  Gandalf wanted him urgently,  he 
would go to Crickhollow, and might even get there first. For Frodo was going 
on foot. His plan - for pleasure and a last look at the Shire as much as any 
other reason  -  was to walk from Hobbiton to  Bucklebury  Ferry, taking  it 

####-fairly easy. 
     'I shall  get  myself a bit  into  training,  too,' he said, looking at 
himself  in  a dusty mirror in the  half-empty  hall.  He  had  not done any 
strenuous walking for a long time, and the reflection  looked rather flabby, 
he thought. 
     After lunch, the Sackville-Bagginses, Lobelia and her sandy-haired son, 
Lotho, turned  up, much to Frodo's annoyance. 'Ours at last!' said  Lobelia, 
as she stepped inside. It was not polite; nor strictly true, for the sale of 
Bag  End  did not take effect  until  midnight.  But Lobelia  can perhaps be 
forgiven: she had been obliged to wait about seventy-seven years  longer for  
Bag End  than she once hoped, and she was now  a  hundred years old. 
Anyway, 
she had  come to see that nothing she had paid for had been carried off; and 
she wanted the keys. It took a long while to satisfy her, as she had brought 
a complete inventory  with her and went  right through  it. In  the end  she 
departed with Lotho and  the spare  key and  the promise that the  other key 
would  be  left at  the  Gamgees' in Bagshot Row.  She  snorted, and  showed 
plainly that she  thought the Gamgees  capable of plundering the hole during  
the night. Frodo did not offer her any tea. 
     He took his own tea with Pippin and Sam Gamgee  in the  kitchen. It had 
been  officially announced that Sam was coming to Buckland  'to  do for  Mr. 
Frodo and look after his bit of garden'; an arrangement that was approved by 
the Gaffer, though it did not console him for the prospect of having Lobelia  
as a neighbour. 
     'Our  last meal at  Bag End!'  said Frodo, pushing back his chair. They 
left the washing up  for Lobelia.  Pippin  and Sam  strapped  up their three 
packs and piled them in the porch. Pippin went out for a last  stroll in the 
garden. Sam disappeared. 
     The sun went down. Bag End seemed sad and gloomy and dishevelled. 
Frodo 
wandered round the familiar rooms,  and saw the light  of the sunset fade on 
the walls,  and  shadows  creep out  of  the  corners.  It  grew slowly dark 
indoors. He went out and walked down to  the gate at the bottom of the path,  
and then on a short way down the Hill Road. He half expected to  see Gandalf 
come striding up through the dusk. 
     The sky was clear and the stars were growing bright. 'It's going  to be 
a fine night,'  he  said  aloud.  'That's good for a beginning.  I feel like 

####-walking. I  can't  bear any  more  hanging about. I am going  to start,  and 
Gandalf must follow  me.'  He  turned to go back, and  then  slopped, for he 
heard voices, just round the corner by the end of Bagshot Row. One voice was 
certainly the old Gaffer's;  the other was strange, and  somehow  unpleasant. 
He could not make out what it said, but he heard the Gaffer's answers, which 
were rather shrill. The old man seemed put out. 
     'No, Mr. Baggins has gone away. Went this morning, and my Sam went 
with 
him: anyway all  his stuff went.  Yes, sold out and  gone,  I tell'ee.  Why?  
Why's none of my business, or yours.  Where to?  That ain't no  secret. He's 
moved to Bucklebury or some such place, away down yonder. Yes it is  - a tidy 
way.  I've never been so far myself; they're  queer folks in Buckland. No, I 
can't give no message. Good night to you!' 
     Footsteps went away down the Hill. Frodo wondered vaguely why  the fact 
that they did not  come on up the Hill seemed a  great relief. 'I am sick of 
questions a nd curiosity  about my doings,  I  suppose,' he thought. 'What an 
inquisitive lot they all  are!' He had half a mind to go and ask  the Gaffer  
who the inquirer was; but he thought better (or worse) of it, and turned and 
walked quickly back to Bag End. 
     Pippin was sitting on his pack  in  the porch. Sam was not there. Frodo 
stepped inside the dark door. 'Sam!' he called. 'Sam! Time!' 
     'Coming, sir!' came  the answer  from far within, followed soon by  Sam 
himself, wiping his mouth. He had been saying farewell to the beer -barrel in 
the cellar. 
     'All aboard, Sam?' said Frodo. 
     'Yes, sir. I'll last for a bit now, sir.' 
     Frodo shut and locked the  round door, and  gave the key  to Sam.  'Run 
down with this to your home, Sam!' he said. 'Then cu t along the Row and meet 
us as quick as you can at the gate in the  lane  beyond the meadows.  We are 
not  going  through  the village  tonight.  Too  many ears pricking and eyes 
prying.' Sam ran off at full speed. 
     'Well, now we're off at last!'  said  Frodo. They shouldered their packs 
and took up their sticks, and  walked round the corner to the  west  side of 
Bag End. 'Good-bye!' said Frodo, looking at the dark blank windows. He 
waved 
his hand, and then turned and (following Bilbo, if  he had known it) hurried 
after Peregrin down  the garden-path. They jumped over the low place in  the 

####-hedge at the bottom and took to the fields, passing into the darkness like a  
rustle in the grasses.  
     At the bottom of the  Hill  on its western  side they came  to  the gate 
opening on to a  narrow lane.  There they  halted and adjusted the straps of 
their packs. Presently  Sam  appeared, trotting quickly and  breathing hard; 
his heavy pack was hoisted high on his shoulders, and he had put on his head 
a tall shapeless fell  bag, which  he called  a hat. In the gloom  he looked 
very much like a dwarf. 
     'I am sure you  have given me all the heaviest stuff,'  said Frodo.  'I  
pity snails, and all that carry their homes on their backs.' 
     'I could take a lot  more yet, sir. My packet is quite light,' said Sam 
stoutly and untruthfully. 
     'No, you  don't,  Sam!' said  Pippin.  'It is  good  for him. He's  got 
nothing except what he ordered us to pack. He's been slack lately, and he'll 
feel the weight less when he's walked off some of his own.' 
     'Be kind to a poor old hobbit!' laughed Frodo. 'I shall be as thin as a  
willow-wand, I'm sure, before I get to Buckland. But I was talking nonsense. 
I suspect you have taken more than your share, Sam, and I shall look into  it 
at our next  packing.'  He  picked  up his  stick  again. 'Well, we all like 
walking  in the dark,' he said,  'so let's put  some miles  behind us before 
bed.' 
     For a short way they followed  the lane westwards. Then leaving it they 
turned left and took quietly to  the  fields again. They went in single file 
along hedgerows and the borders of coppices, and night fell dark about them. 
In their  dark cloaks they were as invisible as if they all had magic rings. 
Since they were  all hobbits, and were  trying  to be silent,  they made  no 
noise that even hobbits would  hear. Even the wild things in  the fields and 
woods hardly noticed their passing. 
     After  some  time they crossed the Water, west of Hobbiton, by a narrow 
plank -bridge.  The stream  was  there no more than  a winding  black ribbon,  
bordered with leaning  alder -trees. A mile or two further south they hastily 
crossed the great  road  from  the Brandywine Bridge; they were  now in  the 
Tookland and  bending south-eastwards they made for the  Green Hill Country. 
As they began to climb its first slopes they looked back and  saw the  lamps  
in Hobbiton far off twinkling in  the gentle  valley of  the  Water. Soon it 
disappeared  in the  folds of the darkened land, and was followed by Bywater 
beside  its grey pool. When the  light of  the  last  farm was  far  behind, 

####-peeping among the trees, Frodo turned and waved a hand in farewell. 
     'I wonder if  I shall ever  look down into that valley  again,' he said 
quietly. 
     When they  had walked for about three hours they rested. The night  was 
clear,  cool, and starry, but smoke-like wisps of mist were creeping up  the 
hill-sides from the streams and deep  meadows. Thin-clad birches, swaying in 
a light wind  above their heads, made a black net aga inst the pale sky. They 
ate a  very  frugal supper (for hobbits), and  then went on again. Soon they 
struck a narrow road, that  went rolling  up and down,  fading grey into the 
darkness ahead: the road to Woodhall, and  Stock, and the Bucklebury  Ferry. 
It climbed away from the  main road  in the Water-valley, and wound over the 
skirts  of  the  Green  Hills  towards  Woody-End,  a  wild  corner  of  the 
Eastfarthing. 
     After a while  they plunged into  a deeply  cloven  track  between tall 
trees that rustled their dry leaves in the night. It was very dark. At first  
they  talked,  or hummed a  tune  softly together, being  now far  away from 
inquisitive ears. Then they marched  on in silence,  and Pippin began to lag 
behind.  At  last, as  they began to   climb  a  steep slope, he  stopped and 
yawned. 
     'I  am  so sleepy,' he said,  'that soon I shall fall down on the road. 
Are you going to sleep on your legs? It is nearly midnight.' 
     'I thought you liked walking in the dark,' said Frodo. 'But there is no 
great  hurry.  Merry expects  us some time the day after  tomorrow; but that 
leaves us nearly two days more. We'll halt at the first likely spot.' 
     'The  wind's in  the West,' said Sam. 'If  we get to the other  side of 
this hill,  we shall find  a spot  that  is  sheltered and snug  enough, sir. 
There is  a dry fir-wood just ahead,  if  I  remember rightly.' Sam knew the 
land well  within twenty miles of  Hobbiton, but that was  the  limit of his 
geography. 
     Just  over the  top  of  the  hill they came on  the patch of fir-wood. 
Leaving  the  road  they  went into  the deep resin -scented  darkness of the 
trees, and  gathered  dead  sticks and cones to make a fire. Soon they had a  
merry crackle of flame at the foot of a large fir-tree and they sat round it 
for  a while, until they began to nod. Then, each in an  angle  of the great 
tree's roots, they curled  up  in  their cloaks and blankets, and were  soon 
fast asleep. They set no  watch; even Frodo feared  no danger yet,  for they 
were still in  the heart  of the Shire. A few  creatures came and  looked at 

####-them when the fire had died away. A fox passing through the wood on business 
of his own stopped several minutes and sniffed. 
     'Hobbits!' he thought. 'Well, what next? I have heard of strange doings 
in this land,  but  I have  seldom  heard of a hobbit  sleeping out of doors 
under a tree. Three of them! There's something mighty queer behind this.' He 
was quite right, but he never found out any more about it. 
     The morning came,  pale and clammy. Frodo woke up first, and found that 
a tree-root had made a hole in his back, and that his neck was stiff. 
     'Walking for pleasure! Why didn't  I drive?'  he thought, as he usually 
did at the beginning of an expedition. 'And all  my  beautiful feather  beds 
are sold to the Sackville-Bagginses! These  tree -roots would  do them good.' 
He stretched. 'Wake up, hobbits!' he cried. It's a beautiful morning.' 
     'What's beautiful about it?' said Pippin, peering  over the edge of his 
blanket with one eye. 'Sam! Gel breakfast ready for half-past nine! Have you 
got the bath-water hot?' 
     Sam jumped up,  looking rather  bleary. 'No,  sir, I haven't, sir!'  he 
said. 
     Frodo stripped the blankets from Pippin and  rolled him  over, and then 
walked off to the edge of the wood. Away eastward the sun was rising red out 
of the mists that lay thick  on  the world. Touched  with  gold and red  the 
autumn trees seemed to  be sailing rootless in a shadowy sea. A little below 
him to the left the road ran down steeply into a hollow and disappeared. 
     When  he returned  Sam  and  Pippin had got a good fire going. 'Water!' 
shouted Pippin. 'Where's the water?' 
     'I  don't keep  water in my  pockets,' said  Frodo. 'We thought you had 
gone to find  some,' said Pippin, busy  setting out the food, and cups. 'You  
had better go now.' 
     'You  can come too,'  said  Frodo, 'and  bring  all the water -bottles.' 
There was  a stream at the foot of the hill. They  filled their  bottles and 
the small  camping kettle at a little fall  where the water fell  a few feet 
over an outcrop  of grey stone. It  was  icy cold;  and they spluttered  and 
puffed as they bathed their faces and hands.  
     When their breakfast was over, and their packs all trussed up again, it 
was after  ten o'clock, and the day was beginning to turn fine and hot. They 
went  down the slope, and across the stream where  it  dived under the road,  
and up the next slope, and up and down another shoulder of the hills; and by 
that time their cloaks, blankets, water , food, and other gear already seemed 

####-a heavy burden. 
     The day's march promised to be warm and tiring  work. After some miles, 
however, the road  ceased to roll up and  down: it climbed  to the  top of a  
steep bank in a weary zig-zagging sort of way, and then prepared to  go down 
for  the last time. In front of  them they saw  the lower lands  dotted with 
small clumps of  trees that melted away in  the distance to a brown woodland 
haze. They were looking across the  Woody End towards  the Brandywine 
River. 
The road wound away before them like a piece of string. 
     'The road goes on  for ever,' said Pippin; 'but I can't without a rest. 
It is  high time for lunch.' He sat down on the bank at the side of the road 
and looked  away east into the haze, beyond which lay the River, and the end 
of the Shire in which he had spent all his life. Sam stood by him. His round 
eyes were wide open  - for he was looking across lands he had never seen to a 
new horizon. 
     'Do Elves live in those woods?' he asked. 
     'Not that I ever  heard,' said Pippin.  Frodo  was silent.  He  too was 
gazing eastward along the road, as if he had never seen it  before. Suddenly 
he spoke, aloud but as if to himself, saying slowly: 
     The Road goes ever on and on  
     Down from the door where it began. 
     Now far ahead the Road has gone, 
     And I must follow, if I can, 
     Pursuing it with weary feet, 
     Until it joins some larger way, 
     Where many paths and errands meet. 
     And whither then? I cannot say. 
     'That sounds  like a bit of old Bilbo's rhyming,' said Pippin. 'Or is it 
one of your imitations? It does not sound altogether encouraging.' 
     'I don't know,' said Frodo. It came to me then, as  if I was making  it 
up; but I  may have heard it long ago. Certainly it reminds  me very much of 
Bilbo in the last years, before he went away. He used often to say there was 
only  one  Road;  that it was like a great river: its  springs were at every 
doorstep,  and every path was  its  tributary. "It's  a dangerous  business,  
Frodo, going out of your door," he used to say. "You step into the Road, and 
if you don't keep your feet,  there is no knowing where  you might  be swept  
off to.  Do you realize  that  this  is the  very  path  that  goes  through 

####-Mirkwood,  and that if you  let it, it  might take you to the Lonely Mountain 
or  even  further and to worse places?"  He  used to say  that  on  the path 
outside the  front door at  Bag End, especially  after he had been out for a  
long walk.' 
     'Well,  the Road won't sweep me  a nywhere for an  hour  at least,' said 
Pippin, unslinging his pack. The others followed his example,  putting their 
packs against the bank and their  legs out  into the road. After a rest they 
had a good lunch, and then more rest. 
     The sun was beginning to get  low and the light of afternoon was on the 
land as they went down the hill. So far they had not met a soul on the road. 
This way was not much used, being hardly fit for carts, and there was little 
traffic to  the Woody End. They had been jogging along again for an hour  or 
more when Sam  stopped a  moment as  if  listening. They were  now on  level 
ground,  and  the  road  after  much  winding  lay  straight  ahead  through 
grass-land sprinkled with tall trees, outliers of the approaching woods.  
     'I can hear a pony or a horse coming along the road behind,' said Sam. 
     They  looked back, but the turn of the  road prevented them from seeing 
far. 'I wonder if that  is Gandalf coming after us,' said Frodo; but even as 
he said it, he had a feeling  that it was not so, and a sudden desire to hide 
from the view of the rider came over him. 
     'It  may not matter much,' he  said apologetically, 'but I would rather  
not be seen on the  road  - by anyone. I am  sick of my  doings being noticed  
and discussed. And if  it is Gandalf,' he added as  an afterthought, 'we can 
give him  a little surprise, to pay him out for being so late. Let's get out 
of sight!' 
     The other two ran quickly to the left and down into a little hollow not 
far  from the  road. There  they lay  flat. Frodo  hesitated  for  a second: 
curiosity or some other feeling was struggling with his desire  to hide. The 
sound of hoofs drew nearer. Just in time he threw himself down in a patch of 
long grass behind a tree that overshadowed the road. Then he lifted his head 
and peered cautiously above one of the great roots. 
     Round the  corner came  a black horse, no hobbit-pony  but a full-sized 
horse;  and  on  it sat  a large man,  who seemed to  crouch in  the saddle, 
wrapped in a great black  cloak and  hood, so that only his boots in the high 
stirrups showed below; his face was shadowed and invisible. 
     When it reached the  tree and was level with Frodo  the  horse stopped. 
The riding figure sat quite still with its head bowed, as if listening. From 

####-inside the hood came  a  noise as of  someone sniffing to  catch an  elusive 
scent; the head turned from side to side of the road. 
     A sudden  unreasoning  fear of  discovery laid hold  of Frodo,  and  he 
thought  of his Ring. He hardly dared  to breathe,  and yet the desire to get 
it out of his pocket became so strong that he began slowly to move his hand. 
He felt  that  he had only to  slip  it on, and then he  would  be safe. The 
advice of Gandalf seemed absurd. Bilbo had used the Ring. 'And I am still in 
the Shire,' he thought, as his hand touched the chain on  which  it hung. At  
that moment  the  rider  sat up,  and  shook the  reins.  The  horse stepped 
forward, walking slowly at first, and then breaking into a quick trot. 
     Frodo crawled to  the edge of the road and watched the rider,  until he 
dwindled into the distance. He could not be quite sure, but it seemed to him 
that suddenly, before it  passed out  of sight,  the horse turned aside  and 
went into the trees on the right. 
     'Well, I  call that very queer, and indeed disturbing,' said  Frodo  to 
himself, as he  walked towards his companions. Pippin and  Sam  had remained 
flat  in the  grass, and had seen nothing; so Frodo  described the rider and 
his strange behaviour. 
     'I can't say why, but I felt certain he was looking or smelling for me; 
and also I felt certain that I did  not want him to discover  me. I've never 
seen or fell anything like it in the Shire before.' 
     'But what has  one of the Big  People got  to do with us?' said Pippin. 
'And what is he doing in this part of the world?' 
     'There are some Men about,' said Frodo. 'Down in the Southfarthing they  
have  had trouble  with Big  People,  I believe. But I have  never heard  of 
anything like this rider. I wonder  where he comes from.' 
     'Begging  your  pardon,' put  in Sam  suddenly,  'I know where he comes 
from. It's from Hobbiton that  this here black  rider comes, unless  there's 
more than one. And I know where he's going to.' 
     'What do you mean?' said Frodo sharply, looking at him in astonishment.  
'Why didn't you speak up before?' 
     'I have only just remembered, sir. It was like this: when I got back to 
our  hole yesterday evening with the key, my dad, he says to me: Hello, Sam! 
he says. I thought you were away with Mr. Frodo this morning. There's been a  
strange customer asking for Mr. Baggins of Bag End, and he's only just gone. 
I've sent him on to Bucklebury. Not that I liked the sound of him. He seemed 
mighty put out, when I told him Mr. Baggins had  left his old home for good. 

####-Hissed at me, he did.  It gave me quite a shudder. What sort of a fellow was  
he? says I to the Gaffer. / don't know,  says he; but he wasn't a hobbit. He 
was tall and black-like, and he  stooped aver me. I reckon it was one of the 
Big Folk from foreign parts. He spoke funny. 
     'I  couldn't stay  to  hear more, sir, since  you were  waiting; and  I 
didn't give much heed to it myself. The Gaffer is getting old, and more than 
a bit blind,  and it  must have been  near dark when this fellow come up the 
Hill  and  found him taking the air at the end of our Row. I hope  he hasn't 
done no harm, sir, nor me.' 
     'The Gaffer can't be blamed anyway,' said Frodo. 'As a matter of fact I 
heard him talking to a  stranger, who  seemed to  be inquiring for me, and I 
nearly went and asked him who it was. I wish I had, or you had told me about 
it before. I might have been more careful on the road.' 
     'Still, there may be no connexion between  this rider and the  Gaffer's 
stranger,' said Pippin. 'We left Hobbiton  secretly enough, and  I don't see 
how he could have followed us.' 
     'What about the smelling, sir?' said Sam. 'And the Gaffer said he was a  
black chap.' 
     'I wish  I had  waited  for  Gandalf,' Frodo  muttered. 'But perhaps it 
would only have made matters worse.' 
     'Then you know  or guess something about this  rider?' said Pippin, who 
had caught the muttered words.  
     'I don't know, and I would rather  not guess,'  said Frodo. 'All right, 
cousin Frodo! You can  keep your  secret for the present,  if you want to be 
mysterious. In the meanwhile what are we to do? I should like a  bite and  a  
sup,  but somehow  I think  we had better move on from here.  Your  talk  of 
sniffing riders with invisible noses has unsettled me.' 
     'Yes, I think we  will move on now,' said Frodo;  'but  not on the road 
-in case  that rider comes back, or another  follows him. We  ought to do  a  
good step more today. Buckland is still miles away.' 
     The shadows  of  the trees  were long and  thin  on the  grass, as they 
started off again. They now kept  a stone's throw to  the left of  the road, 
and kept out of sight of it as much  as they  could. But this hindered them; 
for the grass was thick and  tussocky, and the ground uneven, and the  trees 
began to draw together into thickets.  
     The sun had gone down  red behind the hills at their backs, and evening 
was coming on before they came back to the road at the end of the long level 

####-over which  it had run straight for  some miles.  At that point it bent left 
and  went down into the lowlands of  the Yale  making for Stock;  but a lane 
branched right, winding  through a  wood of ancient oak-trees on its way  to 
Woodhall. 'That is the way for us,' said Frodo. 
     Not far from the road-meeting they came on the huge hulk  of a tree: it 
was  still alive  and had leaves  on  the small branches that it had put out 
round the  broken  stumps of its long-fallen limbs; but it  was hollow,  and 
could  be entered  by  a great  crack  on the  side  away from the road. The 
hobbits crept inside, and sat there upon a floor  of old leaves and  decayed 
wood.  They rested and had a light  meal, talking quietly and listening from 
time to time. 
     Twilight  was about  them as they crept back to the lane. The West wind 
was sighing in the branches. Leaves were whispering. Soon the  road began to 
fall gently but steadily into the dusk. A  star  came out above the trees in 
the darkening East before them.  They went  abreast  and in step, to keep up 
their spirits.  After  a time, as the stars  grew thicker and  brighter, the 
feeling of disquiet left them, and they no longer listened  for the sound of 
hoofs. They began to hum softly, as hobbits have a way of doing as they walk 
along,  especially  when  they  are drawing near to home at night. With most  
hobbits  it  is  a supper -song  or a bed-song;  but these  hobbits  hummed a  
walking-song (though not, of course, without any mention of supper and bed). 
Bilbo Baggins had made the words, to a tune  that  was as old as  the hills, 
and taught  it to Frodo as they walked in the  lanes of the Water -valley and 
talked about Adventure. 
     Upon the hearth the fire is red, 
     Beneath the roof there is a bed; 
     But not yet weary are our feet, 
     Still round the corner we may meet 
     A sudden tree or standing stone 
     That none have seen but we alone. 
     Tree and flower and leaf and grass, 
     Let them pass! Let them pass! 
     Hill and water under sky, 
     Pass them by! Pass them by! 
 
     Still round the corner there may  wait 
     A new road or a secret gate, 

####-     And though we pass them by today, 
     Tomorrow we may come this way 
     And take the hidden paths that run 
     Towards the Moon or to the Sun. 
     Apple, thorn, and nut and sloe, 
     Let them go! Let them go! 
     Sand and stone and pool and dell, 
     Fare you well! Fare you well! 
 
     Home is behind, the world ahead, 
     And there are many paths to tread 
     Through shadows to the edge of night, 
     Until the stars are all alight. 
     Then world behind and home ahead, 
     We'll wander back to home and bed. 
     Mist and twilight, cloud and shade, 
     Away shall fade! Away shall fade! 
     Fire and lamp, and meat and bread, 
     And then to bed! And then to bed! 
     The song ended. 'And now to bed! And now to bed!' sang Pippin in a high 
voice. 
     'Hush!' said Frodo. 'I think I hear hoofs again.' 
     They slopped suddenly  and  stood as silent as tree-shadows, listening. 
There was a sound of hoofs in the lane, some way behind, but coming slow and 
clear down the wind. Quickly and quietly they slipped off the path, and  ran 
into the deeper shade under the oak-trees. 
     'Don't let  us go too far!' said Frodo. 'I don't want to be seen, but I 
want to see if it is another Black Rider.' 
     'Very well!' said Pippin. 'But don't forget the sniffing!' 
     The hoofs drew nearer. They had no time to find any hiding-place better  
than the general  darkness under the trees; Sam and Pippin crouched behind a 
large tree-bole, while  Frodo  crept back a few yards  towards  the lane. It 
showed grey and pale, a line  of fading light through the wood. Above it the 
stars were thick in the dim sky, but there was no moon. 
     The sound of hoofs stopped. As Frodo watched he saw something dark pass 
across  the lighter  space between two trees, and then halt. It looked  like 
the  black shade of a horse led by a smaller black  shadow. The black shadow 

####-stood close  to the point where they had left the  path, and it  swayed from 
side to side. Frodo thought he heard the sound of  snuffling. The shadow bent 
to the ground, and then began to crawl towards him. 
     Once more the desire to slip on the Ring came over Frodo; but this time 
it was stronger than before. So strong that, almost before he  realized what 
he was  doing, his hand was groping  in his pocket. But at that moment there 
came  a sound  like mingled song and laughter. Clear voices rose and fell in  
the starlit air. The black shadow straightened up and retreated.  It climbed 
on to the  shadowy  horse  and  seemed  to  vanish  across the lane into the 
darkness on the other side. Frodo breathed again. 
     'Elves!' exclaimed Sam in a hoarse whisper. 'Elves, sir!' He would have 
burst  out of the trees and dashed off towards  the voices, if they  had not 
pulled him back. 
     'Yes,  it  is Elves,' said  Frodo. 'One can meet them sometimes  in the 
Woody End.  They don't live in the Shire, but they  wander into it in Spring 
and  Autumn,  out  of their own  lands away  beyond the  Tower Hills.  I  am 
thankful that they do! You did not  see, but  that Black  Rider stopped just  
here and was actually crawling towards us when the song began. As soon as he 
heard the voices he slipped away.' 
     'What  about the Elves?'  said  Sam, too  excited  to trouble about the 
rider. 'Can't we go and see them?' 
     'Listen! They are coming this way,' said Frodo. 'We have only to wait.' 
The singing drew nearer. One clear voice rose now above  the others.  It was 
singing in the fair elven-tongue, of which Frodo knew only a little, and the 
others knew nothing. Yet  the sound blending with the melody seemed to shape 
itself  in their thought into words which they only partly understood.  This 
was the song as Frodo heard it: 
     Snow-white! Snow-white! O Lady clear! 
     O Queen beyond the Western Seas! 
     O Light to us that wander here 
     Amid the world of woven trees! 
 
     Gilthoniel! O Elbereth! 
     Clear are thy eyes and bright thy breath! 
     Snow-white! Snow-white! We sing to thee 
     In a far land beyond the Sea. 
 

####-     O stars that in the Sunless Year 
     With shining hand by her were sawn, 
     In windy fields now bright and clear 
     We see your silver blossom blown! 
 
     O Elbereth! Gilthoniel! 
     We still remember, we who dwell 
     In this far land beneath the trees, 
     Thy starlight on the Western Seas. 
     The  song  ended.  'These  are High  Elves!  They  spoke  the  name  of 
Elbereth!' said Frodo in amazement,  'Few of that fairest folk are ever seen 
in the Shire. Not many now remain in Middle-earth,  east  of the  Great Sea. 
This is indeed a strange chance!' 
     The hobbits  sat in shadow  by the wayside. Before long the Elves  came 
down the lane towards the valley. They  passed slowly, and the hobbits could 
see the starlight glimmering on their hair and  in their  eyes. They bore no  
lights,  yet as they walked a  shimmer, like the light of the moon above the 
rim of the hills before it rises, seemed to fall about their feet. They were 
now silent, and  as the last Elf  passed  he turned  and looked  towards the 
hobbits and laughed. 
     'Hail,  Frodo!' he  cried. 'You  are  abroad  late. Or are  you perhaps 
lost?'  Then he called aloud  to the others, and all the company stopped and 
gathered round. 
     'This  is indeed  wonderful!'  they  said. 'Three hobbits in  a wood at 
night! We  have not seen  such a thing  since Bilbo went away.  What is  the 
meaning of it?' 
     'The meaning of it, fair people,'  said Frodo, 'is simply that  we seem 
to be going the same  way as you are. I like  walking under the stars. But I 
would welcome your company.' 
     'But we have no need of other company, and hobbits are  so  dull,' they 
laughed. 'And how do you know that we go the same way as you, for you do 
not 
know whither we are going?' 
     'And how do you know my name?' asked Frodo in return. 
     'We know many things,'  they said. 'We have seen you often before  with 
Bilbo, though you may not have seen us.' 
     'Who are you, and who is your lord?' asked Frodo. 

####-     'I am Gildor,' answered their leader, the Elf who had first hailed him. 
'Gildor Inglorion of  the  House  of Finrod. We are Exiles, and most of  our 
kindred have long  ago  departed and  we  too are  now only  tarrying here a  
while, ere we return  over the Great Sea.  But some  of  our kinsfolk  dwell 
still  in peace in Rivendell.  Come now, Frodo, tell us what you  are doing?  
For we see that there is some shadow of fear upon you.' 
     'O Wise  People!' interrupted Pippin eagerly. 'Tell us about  the Black  
Riders!' 
     'Black Riders?' they said  in  low voices. 'Why  do you ask a bout Black  
Riders?' 
     'Because two Black Riders have  overtaken us today,  or one has done so 
twice,' said Pippin;  'only a little while ago  he slipped away as you  drew 
near.' 
     The Elves did not answer at  once, but spoke together  softly  in their 
own tongue.  At length Gildor turned to the  hobbits. 'We  will not speak of 
this here,' he said. 'We think you had  best come now with us. It is not our 
custom, but for this time we will lake you on our road, and  you shall lodge 
with us tonight, if you  will.' 
     'O Fair  Folk!  This is good fortune beyond my hope,' said  Pippin. Sam 
was speechless.  'I  thank you indeed, Gildor Inglorion,' said Frodo bowing. 
'Elen snla l®menn' omentielvo, a star shines on the hour of our meeting,' he 
added in the high-elven speech. 
     'Be careful,  friends!' cried  Gildor laughing. 'Speak no secrets! Here 
is  a  scholar in  the  Ancient  Tongue.  Bilbo  was a  good  master.  Hail, 
Elf-friend!' he said, bowing to Frodo.  'Come now with your friends and join 
our company! You had best walk in the middle so  that you may not stray. You  
may be weary before we halt.' 
     'Why? Where are you going?' asked Frodo. 
     'For tonight we go to the woods on the hills above Woodhall. It is some 
miles, but  you shall have  rest at  the  end of it, and it will shorten your 
journey tomorrow.' 
     They now marched on again in silence, and passed like shadows and faint 
lights: for  Elves  (even  more  than hobbits)  could walk when they  wished  
without sound or footfall.  Pippin soon began  to feel sleepy, and staggered 
once  or twice; but each time a tall Elf at his side  put out  his  arm  and 
saved him from a  fall. Sam walked along at Frodo's side, as if in a  dream, 
with an expression on his face half of fear and half of astonished  joy. 

####-     The  woods on either side became denser; the trees were now younger and 
thicker;  and as the lane went lower, running down into a fold of the hills, 
there were many deep brakes of hazel on the rising slopes at either hand. At  
last the Elves turned aside from the path.  A  green ride  lay almost unseen 
through the  thickets on the right; and this they  followed as it wound away 
back up the  wooded slopes on to the  top of a shoulder of  the  hills  that 
stood out into the lower land of the river -valley. Suddenly they came out of 
the shadow of  the trees, and  before them lay a  wide space of  grass, grey 
under the night. On three sides the woods  pressed upon it; but eastward the 
ground fell steeply and the tops of the dark trees, growing at the bottom of 
the slope,  were  below their feet. Beyond, the  low lands  lay dim and flat 
under the stars.  Nearer  at hand  a few lights twinkled  in the village  of 
Woodhall. 
     The  Elves sat on  the grass  and spoke  together in  soft voices; they 
seemed to take no further  notice of the hobbits.  Frodo and his  companions 
wrapped themselves in cloaks and blankets, and drowsiness stole  over  them. 
The  night grew  on,  and  the  lights in the valley  went out. Pippin  fell 
asleep, pillowed on a green hillock. 
     Away  high  in the East swung Remmirath,  the Netted Stars,  and slowly 
above  the mists red Borgil rose, glowing like a jewel of fire. Then by some 
shift of airs all the mist was drawn away like a veil, and there leaned  up, 
as  he  climbed  over  the  rim  of the  world, the  Swordsman  of  the  Sky, 
Menelvagor with  his shining  belt. The  Elves all burst into song. Suddenly 
under the trees a fire sprang up with a red light. 
     'Come!' the  Elves called to the hobbits. 'Come!  Now is  the time  for 
speech and merriment!' 
     Pippin sat up and rubbed his eyes. He shivered. 'There is a fire in the 
hall, and food for hungry guests,' said an Elf standing before him. 
     At the south  end of the greensward  there  was an opening.  There  the 
green  floor  ran on into the wood, and formed a  wide  space like  a  hall, 
roofed by the boughs of trees. Their great trunks ran like pillars down each 
side. In the middle there was a wood-fire blazing, and upon the tree-pillars 
torches with lights of gold and silver were burning  steadily. The Elves sat 
round the  fire upon the grass or  upon the  sawn  rings of old trunks. Some 
went  to  and  fro bearing cups and  pouring  drink; others brought  food on 
heaped plates and dishes.  
     'This  is poor fare,' they said  to the hobbits; 'for we are lodging in 

####-the greenwood far from  our halls. If ever  you are our guests at  home,  we 
will treat you better.' 
     'It seems to me good enough for a birthday-party,' said Frodo. 
     Pippin afterwards recalled little o f either food or drink, for his mind 
was  filled  with the  light upon the elf-faces, and the  sound of voices so 
various and so beautiful that he felt in a waking  dream.  But he remembered  
that there was bread, surpassing the savour of a fair white  loaf to one who 
is starving;  and fruits  sweet  as  wildberries  and richer than the tended 
fruits of gardens; he drained a cup that was filled with a fragrant draught, 
cool as a clear fountain, golden as a summer afternoon. 
     Sam could never describe in words, nor picture clearly to himself, what 
he felt or thought that  night, though it remained in  his  memory as one of 
the chief  events of his life.  The  nearest he  ever got was to say: 'Well, 
sir, if I could grow  apples like that, I would call  myself a gardener. But 
it was the singing that went to my heart, if you know what I mean.' 
     Frodo sat, eating, drinking, and talking with delight; but his mind was 
chiefly on the words spoken. He knew a little of the elf-speech and listened 
eagerly. Now and again he spoke to those that served him and thanked them in 
their own language. They smiled at  him  and said laughing: 'Here is a jewel 
among hobbits!' 
     After a while Pippin fell fast asleep, and was lifted up and borne away 
to a bower under the trees; there he was laid upon a soft bed and  slept the 
rest  of the night away. Sam refused to  leave  his  master. When Pippin had 
gone, he came and sat curled up at Frodo's feet, where at last he nodded and 
closed his eyes. Frodo remained long awake, talking with Gildor. 
     They  spoke of many things, old  and new,  and Frodo questioned  Gildor  
much about happenings  in the wide world outside the Shire. The tidings were 
mostly  sad and ominous: of  gathering  darkness, the wars  of Men,  and the 
flight of the Elves. At last Frodo asked  the question  that  was nearest to 
his heart: 
     'Tell me, Gildor, have you ever seen Bilbo since he left us?' 
     Gildor  smiled.  'Yes,' he answered.  'Twice. He said farewell to us on 
this very  spot. But I saw  him once again, far  from here.' He would say no 
more about Bilbo, and Frodo fell silent. 
     'You do not ask me or tell me much that concerns yourself, Frodo,' said 
Gildor. 'But I already know a little, and I  can read more in your  face and 
in the thought behind your questions. You are leaving the Shire, and yet you  

####-doubt that you will find  what you seek, or accomplish what  you intend,  or  
that you will ever return. Is not that so?' 
     'It is,' said Frodo; 'but I thought my going was a secret known only to 
Gandalf and my faithful Sam.' He looked down at Sam, who was snoring 
gently. 
     'The secret will not reach the Enemy from us,' said Gildor. 
     'The Enemy?' said Frodo. 'Then you know why I am leaving the Shire?' 
     'I  do not know  for what  reason the Enemy is pursuing you,'  answered 
Gildor; 'but I perceive that he is  - strange indeed though that seems to me. 
And I warn  you  that peril is now both before you  and behind you, and upon 
either side.' 
     'You  mean the Riders? I feared  that  they were servants of the Enemy. 
What are the Black Riders?' 
     'Has Gandalf told you nothing?' 
     'Nothing about such creatures.' 
     'Then I think it  is not  for me to say more  - lest terror should keep 
you from your journey. For it seems to me that you  have set out only just in 
time, if  indeed you are in time. You must now make  haste, and neither stay 
nor turn back; for the Shire is no longer any protection to you.' 
     'I cannot  imagine what information could be more terrifying  than your 
hints  and warnings,' exclaimed Frodo. 'I knew  that  danger lay  ahead,  of 
course; but I did not expect to  meet it in  our  own Shire.  Can't a hobbit 
walk from the Water to the River in peace?' 
     'But  it is not your own Shire,' said Gildor. 'Others dwelt here before 
hobbits were; and others will dwell here again when hobbits are no more. The 
wide world is all about you: you can fence yourselves in, but you cannot for  
ever fence it out.' 
     'I know - and yet it has always seemed so safe and familiar. What can I 
do  now?  My  plan was  to  leave  the Shire  secretly, and  make my  way to 
Rivendell; but now my footsteps are dogged, before ever I get to Buckland.' 
     'I  think you should still follow that  plan,'  said Gildor.  'I do not 
think the Road  will prove too  hard for  your courage. But  if  you  desire 
clearer counsel, you should ask  Gandalf. I do not know the reason  for your  
flight, and therefore I do not know by what means your  pursuers will assail  
you. These things Gandalf must know. I suppose that you  will see him before 
you leave the Shire?' 
     'I hope so. But that is another  thing that  makes  me anxious. I  have 

####-been expecting Gandalf for many days. He was to have come to Hobbiton at 
the 
latest two  nights  ago; but he has  never appeared. Now I am wondering what 
can have happened. Should I wait for him?' 
     Gildor  was silent for a moment. 'I do not like this news,' he said  at 
last.  'That Gandalf should be late, does not  bode well. But it is said: Do 
not meddle  in  the  affairs  o f Wizards, for they  are subtle  and quick to  
anger. The choice is yours: to go or wait.' 
     'And  it  is also  said,'  answered  Frodo:  'Go not  to the  Elves for 
counsel, for they will say both no and yes.' 
     'Is it  indeed?' laughed Gildor. 'Elves  seldom give  unguarded advice, 
for advice is a  dangerous gift,  even from  the  wise to the wise, and  all 
courses may run ill. But what would you? You have not told me all concerning 
yourself; and how then shall  I choose better  than you? But if  you  demand  
advice, I will for friendship's sake give it.  I think you  should now go at 
once, without delay; and if Gandalf does not come before you set out, then I  
also advise  this:  do not  go  alone. Take such friends  as are trusty  and 
willing. Now you should be grateful, for I do  not give this counsel gladly. 
The Elves have their  own labours and their own sorrows, and they are little  
concerned  with the ways of  hobbits,  or of any other creatures upon earth. 
Our  paths cross theirs seldom, by chance or purpose. In this meeting  there 
may be more than chance; but the purpose  is not clear to  me, and I fear to 
say too much.' 
     'I am  deeply grateful,' said  Frodo;  'but  I  wish you would  tell me 
plainly what the  Black  Riders  are. If I  take your  advice I may not  see 
Gandalf for  a  long while,  and I ought to know what  is  the  danger  that 
pursues me.' 
     'Is  it not  enough to  know  that they  are servants  of  the  Enemy?' 
answered Gildor. 'Flee them! Speak no words to them! They are deadly. Ask no 
more of me! But my heart forbodes that, ere all is ended, you,  Frodo son of 
Drogo, will  know more  of  these  fell things than  Gildor  Inglorion.  May 
Elbereth protect you!' 
     'But where shall I find courage?' asked Frodo. 'That is what I  chiefly 
need.' 
     'Courage is found in unlikely places,' said  Gildor. 'Be  of good hope!  
Sleep now! In the morning we shall have gone; but we will send our  messages 

####-through  the lands.  The Wandering Companies shall know of your journey, 
and 
those that have power for good shall be on the watch. I name you Elf-friend; 
and  may the stars shine upon the end  of your road! Seldom have we had such 
delight in strangers,  and it  is  fair to hear words  of the Ancient Speech 
from the lips of other wanderers in the world.' 
     Frodo felt sleep coming upon him, even as Gildor  finished speaking. 'I  
will sleep now,' he said; and the  Elf led him to a bower beside Pippin, and 
he threw himself upon a bed and fell at once into a dreamless slumber. 
 

####- 

Chapter 4. A Short Cut to Mushrooms 

 
 
     In the morning Frodo woke refreshed. He was lying in  a bower made by a 
living tree  with branches laced  and drooping to the ground; his bed was of 
fern and grass,  deep and soft  and  strangely fragrant. The sun was shining 
through  the fluttering leaves,  which were still green  upon the  tree.  He 
jumped up and went out. 
     Sam  was  sitting  on the grass near the  edge  of the wood. Pippin was 
standing studying the sky and weather. There was no sign of the Elves.  
     'They have left us fruit  and drink, and bread,' said Pippin. 'Come and 
have your breakfast. The bread tastes almost as good as it did last night. I 
did not want to leave you any, but Sam insisted.' 
     Frodo  sat  down  beside  Sam and began  to eat. 'Wha t is the  plan for  
today?' asked Pippin. 
     'To  walk  to Bucklebury as  quickly as possible,'  answered Frodo, and 
gave his attention to the food. 
     'Do you think  we shall see  anything  of  those Riders?' asked  Pippin 
cheerfully. Under  the  morning  sun the prospect of seeing a whole troop of 
them did not seem very alarming to him. 
     'Yes, probably,' said Frodo, not liking  the reminder. 'But  I  hope to 
get across the river without their seeing us.' 
     'Did you find out anything about them from Gildor?' 
     'Not much  - only hints and riddles,' said Frodo evasively. 'Did you ask  
about the sniffing?' 
     'We didn't discuss it,' said Frodo with his mouth full. 
     'You should have. I am sure it is very important.' 
     'In that case I am sure Gildor would have refused  to explain it,' said 
Frodo sharply. 'And now leave me in peace  for a bit! I don't want to answer  
a string of questions while I am eating. I want to think!' 
     'Good heavens!' said Pippin. 'At breakfast?' He walked away towards the 
edge of the green. 
     From Frodo's mind the bright morning - treacherously bright, he thought  
- had not banished the fear of pursuit; and he pondered the words of Gildor. 
The merry voice of Pippin came to him. He was running  on the green turf and 
singing. 

####-     'No!  I could  not!' he said  to  himself.  'It is one thing to take my 
young friends walking over the Shire with me, until we are hungry and weary, 
and food  and  bed are  sweet.  To  take them into exile,  where  hunger and 
weariness may ha ve  no cure,  is quite another  - even if they are willing to 
come. The inheritance  is mine  alone.  I don't think I  ought  even to take 
Sam.' He looked at Sam Gamgee, and discovered that Sam was watching him. 
     'Well, Sam!' he said. 'What about it? I am leaving the Shire as soon as 
ever I  can - in fact I  have made up my mind now not even to wait  a day at 
Crickhollow, if it can be helped.' 
     'Very good, sir!' 
     'You still mean to come with me?' 
     'I do.' 
     'It  is going to be very dangerous, Sam. 'It is already dangerous. Most  
likely neither of us will come back.' 
     'If you don't come back, sir, then I shan't, that's certain,' said Sam. 
'Don't you leave him! they said to me. Leave him! I said. I never mean to. I 
am  going  with  him, if   he climbs to the Moon,  and if  any of those Black 
Rulers try to stop him, they'll have Sam Gamgee to reckon with, I said. They 
laughed.' 
     'Who are they, and what are you talking about?' 
     'The  Elves, sir. We had some talk last night; and  they seemed to know 
you were going away, so I didn't see the use of denying  it. Wonderful folk, 
Elves, sir! Wonderful!' 
     'They are,' said Frodo.  'Do you like  them still,  now  you have had a  
closer view?' 
     'They  seem a bit above my likes and dislikes,  so  to speak,' answered 
Sam slowly. 'It don't seem to matter what I think about them. They are quite 
different from what I expected - so old and young, and so gay and sad, as it 
were.' 
     Frodo looked at Sam rather startled, half expecting to see some  outward 
sign of the odd change that seemed  to have come  over him. It did not sound 
like the voice of the old Sam Gamgee that he thought he  knew. But it looked 
like the old  Sam Gamgee sitting  there, except that  his face was unusually 
thoughtful. 
     'Do  you feel any  need to  leave the Shire now  - now that your wish to 
see them has come true already?' he asked. 
     'Yes,  sir. I  don't  know how to  say it, but after last night  I feel 

####-different. I seem to see ahead, in a kind  of way.  I know  we are going  to 
take a very long road, into darkness; but I know I can't turn back. It isn't  
to see Elves now, nor dragons, nor mountains, that  I want  - I don't rightly 
know what I  want: but I  have something to do before the end, and  it  lies 
ahead, not  in the Shire. I must see it through, sir, if you understand me.' 
     'I don't  altogether.  But I  understand  that Gandalf chose me a  good 
companion. I am content. We will go together.' 
     Frodo finished his  breakfast in silence.  Then standing  up he  looked 
over the land ahead, and called to Pippin. 
     'All ready to start?' he said as Pippin ran up. 'We must be getting off 
at once. We slept late; and there are a good many miles to go.' 
     'You slept  late, you mean,' said Pippin. 'I was up long before; and we 
are only waiting for you to finish eating and thinking.' 
     'I  have finished both now. And I am going to make for Bucklebury Ferry 
as quickly  as possible. I am not  going out of the way, back to the road we 
left last night: I am going to  cut straight across country from here.' 
     'Then you are going to fly,'  said Pippin.  'You  won't cut straight on 
foot anywhere in this country.' 
     'We  can  cut  straighter than the road anyway,'  answered  Frodo. 'The 
Ferry is east from Woodhall;  but the hard road curves away to the left  -you  
can see a bend of it away north over there. It goes round  the north  end of 
the Marish so as to  strike  the causeway from  the  Bridge above Stock. But 
that is miles out of the way.  We could save a quarter  of the distance if we 
made a line for the Ferry from where we stand.' 
     'Short cuts make  long delays,' argued  Pippin. 'The  country  is rough 
round  here, and  there are bogs and  all  kinds of difficulties down in the 
Marish -I know the land  in these parts. And if you are worrying about Black 
Riders, I can't  see that it is any worse meeting  them on  a road than in a  
wood or a field.' 
     'It is  less  easy  to find people in the  woods and  fields,' answered 
Frodo. 'And if you are supposed to be on the road, there is some chance that 
you will be looked for on the road and not off it.' 
     'All right!' said Pippin. 'I will follow  you into every bog and ditch. 
But it is  hard! I had counted  on  passing the Golden Perch at Stock before 
sundown. The best beer in the Eastfarthing, or used to be: it is a long time 
since I tasted it.' 
     'That settles it!'  said Frodo. 'Short cuts  make delays, but inns make 

####-longer  ones. At all costs we must  keep  you away from the Golden Perch. We 
want to get to Bucklebury before dark. What do you say, Sam?' 
     'I  will go  along with you, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam (in spite of  private 
misgiving and a deep regret for the best beer in the Eastfarthing). 
     'Then  if we are going to toil  through bog and briar, let's  go  now!' 
said Pippin. 
     It was  already nearly as hot as it had been the day before; but clouds 
were  beginning  to come up from the West. It looked likely to turn to rain. 
The hobbits scrambled down a steep  green  bank and  plunged into the  thick 
trees below. Their course  had been chosen to  leave Woodhall to their left, 
and  to cut slanting through the woods that clustered along the eastern side 
of  the  hills,  until they reached the flats  beyond. Then they  could make 
straight  for the Ferry over country that was open, except for a few ditches 
and fences. Frodo reckoned they had eighteen miles to go in a straight line. 
     He soon found that the thicket was closer and more tangled than it  had 
appeared. There were no paths  in the  undergrowth, and they did not  get on 
very  fast.  When they had struggled to the bottom of the bank, they found a  
stream  running  down from  the hills behind in a deeply dug bed with  steep 
slippery sides overhung with brambles. Most inconveniently it cut across the 
line they had chosen. They could  not jump over it, nor indeed get across it 
at  all without  getting wet, scratched, and muddy.  They  halted, wondering  
what to do.  'First check!' said Pippin, smiling grimly. 
     Sam Gamgee  looked back.  Through an opening  in  the trees he caught a 
glimpse of the top of the green bank from which they had climbed down. 
     'Look!'  he said, clutching  Frodo by the  arm. They all looked, and on 
the edge high above  them they saw against the sky a horse  standing. Beside 
it stooped a black figure. 
     They  at once gave  up any  idea of going back. Frodo led  the way, and 
plunged quickly into the  thick bushes beside the stream. 'Whew!' he said to  
Pippin. 'We were both right! The short cut has gone crooked already; but   we 
got under  cover only just in time. You've got sharp ears, Sam: can you hear  
anything coming?' 
     They  stood still,  almost holding  their breath as  they listened; but 
there was  no sound  of pursuit. 'I  don't fancy  he  would try bringing his 
hor se down that bank,' said Sam. 'But I guess he  knows we came down it.  We 
had better be going on.' 
     Going  on was  not altogether easy.  They had packs  to carry,  and the 

####-bushes and  brambles were reluctant to  let  them through. They were cut off  
from the wind by  the ridge behind, and the air  was still  and stuffy. When 
they forced their way at last into more open ground, they were hot and tired 
and very scratched, and they were also no longer certain of the direction in 
which they  were  going.  The banks of  the stream sank,  as it reached  the 
levels and  became broader  and shallower,  wandering off towards the Marish 
and the River. 
     'Why,  this  is  the Stock-brook!' said Pippin. 'If we are going to try 
and get back on to our course, we must  cross at once and bear right.' 
     They waded  the  stream, and hurried over a wide open space, rush-grown 
and treeless, on the  further side. Beyond that they came again to a belt of 
trees: tall oaks, for the most part, with here  and there an elm tree or  an 
ash. The ground was fairly level, and  there was little undergrowth; but the 
trees were loo close for them to see far  ahead.  The leaves blew upwards in 
sudden gusts of wind, and spots of rain began to fall from the overcast sky. 
Then the wind died  away and the rain came streaming down. They trudged 
along 
as fast as they could, over patches of grass, and through  thick  drifts  of 
old leaves; and all about them the rain pattered  and trickled. They did not 
talk, but kept glancing back, and from side to side. 
     After  half an hour Pippin said: 'I hope  we  have not turned  too much 
towards the south, and are not walking longwise through this wood! It is not  
a very broad belt --I should  have said  no more than a mile at the widest  - 
and we ought to have been through it by now.' 
     'It is no good our starting to go in zig-zags,' said Frodo. 'That won't  
mend  matters. Let us keep on as we  are going! I am not sure that I want to 
come out into the open yet.' 
     They  went on for perhaps another couple of miles. Then the sun gleamed 
out of ragged clouds  again and the rain  lessened. It was now past mid-day,  
and they felt it was high time for lunch. They halted under an elm tree: its 
leaves  though fast turning yellow were still thick, and the  ground at  its 
feel  was fairly dry and sheltered. When  they came to make their meal, they 
found that  the  Elves had  filled their bottles  with  a  clear drink, pale 
golden in colour: it had the scent of a honey made  of many flowers, and was 
wonderfully  refreshing. Very soon they  were  laughing, and snapping  their  
fingers at rain, and at Black Riders.  The last few  miles, they felt, would 
soon be behind them. 

####-     Frodo propped his back against the tree-trunk, and closed his eyes. Sam 
and Pippin sat near, and they began to hum, and then to sing softly: 
     Ho! Ho! Ho! to the bottle I go 
     To heal my heart and drown my woe. 
     Rain may fall and wind may blow,  
     And many miles be still to go, 
     But under a tall tree I will lie, 
     And let the clouds go sailing by. 
     Ho! Ho! Ho! they began again louder. They stopped short suddenly. Frodo 
sprang to his feet. A long-drawn wail came  down the wind, like  the  cry of 
some evil  and  lonely  creature.  It  rose and fell, and  ended  on  a high 
piercing  note. Even as  they sat and stood, as  if suddenly frozen,  it was 
answered by another  cry, fainter and further off, but no less  chilling  to 
the blood. There was then a silence, broken only by the sound of the wind in 
the leaves. 
     'And what do you think that was?' Pippin asked at last, trying to speak 
lightly, but quavering a little. 'If it was a bird, it was  one that I never  
heard in the Shire before.' 
     'It was not bird or beast,' said Frodo. 'It was a call, or  a signal -- 
there were words in that cry, though  I  could not catch them. But no hobbit 
has such a voice.' 
     No more was said about it. They were all thinking of the Riders, but no 
one  spoke of them. They  were now reluctant either to  stay  or go  on; but 
sooner or  later they had got to  get across the  open country to the Ferry, 
and  it was best to go  sooner  and  in daylight.  In a few moments they had 
shouldered their packs again and were off. 
     Before long the wood came  to a  sudden end. Wide grass-lands stretched 
before them. They now saw that  they had, in  fact, turned too much  to  the 
south.  Away over  the  flats  they could glimpse the low hill of Bucklebury 
across the River, but it was now to their left. Creeping cautiously out from 
the edge of the trees,  they set off  across  the  open  as  quickly as they 
could. 
     At first they felt afraid, away from the shelter of  the wood. Far back  
behind them stood the  high place  where  they had  breakfasted.  Frodo half 
expected to see the small distant  figure of  a horseman on  the ridge  dark 
against  the sky; but there was  no sign of  one. The  sun escaping from the 
breaking clouds, as it sank towards the hills they had left, was now shining 

####-brightly again. Their fear left them, though they still felt uneasy. But the 
land  became  steadily  more  tame and  well-ordered.  Soon they  came  into  
well-tended fields and meadows: there were  hedges  and gates  and dikes for 
drainage. Everything seemed quiet and peaceful, just an  ordinary corner  of 
the Shire. Their spirits rose with every step. The  line  of  the River grew 
nearer; and the Black Riders began  to seem  like phantoms of  the woods now 
left far behind. 
     They passed along the edge of a huge turnip-field, and  came to a stout 
gate.  Beyond it a  rutted  lane ran between low well-laid hedges towards  a  
distant clump of trees. Pippin stopped. 
     'I know these fields and this gate!' he said. 'This is Bamfurlong,  old 
Farmer Maggot's land. That's his farm away there in the trees.' 
     'One trouble after  another!' said Frodo, looking nearly as much alarmed 
as if Pippin  had declared the lane was the slot leading to  a dragon's den. 
The others looked at him in surprise. 
     'What's wrong with  old Maggot?' asked Pippin.  'He's a good  friend to 
all the  Brandy  bucks.  Of course he's  a terror to trespassers, and  keeps 
ferocious  dogs  - but after all, folk down here are near the border and have 
to be more on their guard.' 
     'I  know,' said  Frodo. 'But all the same,' he added with  a shamefaced 
laugh,  'I am  terrified of  him and his dogs. I have avoided  his  farm for  
years and  years. He  caught me  several times trespassing after  mushrooms,  
when I was a youngster at Brandy Hall. On the last occasion he beat  me, and 
then took  me  and showed  me to his dogs. "See, lads," he  said, "next time 
this young varmint sets foot on my land, you can eat  him. Now see him off!" 
They chased me all the way to the Ferry. I have never got over the  fright  - 
though I  daresay  the beasts knew their business and  would not really have 
touched me.' 
     Pippin laughed. 'Well, it's time you  made it up. Especially if you are 
coming back to live  in Buckland. Old Maggot is really  a stout fellow -  if 
you leave his mushrooms alone. Let's get into the lane and then we shan't be 
trespassing. If we meet him, I'll do the talking. He is a friend of Merry's,  
and I used to come here with him a good deal at one time.' 
     They went along the lane, until they saw the  thatched roofs of a large 
house and farm-buildings peeping ou t among the trees ahead. The Maggots, 
and 
the Puddifoots of  Stock, and most of  the  inhabitants of  the Marish, were 

####-house-dwellers; and this farm was stoutly built of brick and had a high wall 
all round it. There was a wide wooden gate opening out of the  wall into the  
lane. 
     Suddenly  as they drew nearer  a terrific baying and barking broke out, 
and a loud voice was heard shouting: 'Grip! Fang! Wolf! Come on, lads!' 
     Frodo and Sam stopped dead, but Pippin walked  on a few paces. The gate 
opened and  three  huge dogs came  pelting  out  into  the  lane, and dashed 
towards the travellers, barking fiercely. They took no notice of Pippin; but 
Sam shrank  against the wall, while  two wolvish-looking dogs sniffed at him 
suspiciously, and snarled if he moved. The largest and most ferocious of the 
three halted in front of Frodo, bristling and growling. 
     Through the gate there now appeared  a broad  thick -set  hobbit  with a  
round  red  face. 'Hallo! Hallo!  And who may you  be, and what  may you  be 
wanting?' he asked. 
     'Good afternoon, Mr. Maggot!' said Pippin. 
     The farmer looked at  him closely. 'Well, if it  isn't Master Pippin   - 
Mr. Peregrin Took, I should say!' he cried, changing from a scowl to a grin. 
'It's a long time since I saw you round here. It's lucky for you that I know 
you. I was just going out to  set my dogs  on  any strangers. There are some 
funny things going  on today. Of course, we do get queer folk  wandering  in  
these parts at times. Too near the River,' he said, shaking his  head.  'But 
this fellow was the most outlandish I have ever set eyes  on. He won't cross 
my land without leave a second time, not if I can stop it.' 
     'What fellow do you mean?' asked Pippin. 
     'Then you haven't  seen him?' said  the  farmer. 'H e  went up the  lane 
towards the  causeway not  a  long while back. He  was a funny  customer and 
asking funny questions. But perhaps you'll come along inside, and we'll pass 
the news more comfortable. I've a  drop  of good ale on tap, if you and your  
friends are willing, Mr. Took.' 
     It seemed plain that the  farmer would tell them more, if allowed to do 
it in his own time and  fashion, so they all accepted  the invitation. 'What 
about the dogs?' asked Frodo anxiously. 
     The farmer laughed.  'They  won't harm you - not unless I  tell 'em to. 
Here, Grip! Fang! Heel!' he cried. 'Heel, Wolf!'  To the relief of Frodo and 
Sam, the dogs walked away and let them go free. 
     Pippin introduced  the other two to the farmer. 'Mr. Frodo Baggins,' he 
said.  'You may not remember him, but he used to live at Brandy Hall.' At the 

####-name Baggins the farmer started, and gave Frodo a sharp glance. For a moment 
Frodo thought that the memory of stolen mushrooms had been aroused, and 
that 
the dogs would be  told  to see him   off. But Farmer Maggot took him by  the 
arm. 
     'Well, if that isn't queerer than ever?'  he exclaimed. 'Mr. Baggins is 
it? Come inside! We must have a talk.' 
     They went  into the farmer's  kitchen, and sat by  the wide fire-place. 
Mrs. Maggot brought out  beer in  a huge jug, and filled four large mugs. It 
was a good brew,  and Pippin found himself more than compensated for 
missing 
the  Golden  Perch.  Sam  sipped his  beer  suspiciously.  He had a  natural 
mistrust of the inhabitants of other parts of the Shire; and also he was not 
disposed to be quick  friends with anyone who had beaten his master, however  
long ago. 
     After  a few remarks about  the weather and the agricultural  prospects 
(which were no worse than usual), Farmer Maggot put down his  mug and 
looked 
at them all in turn. 
     'Now, Mr.  Peregrin,' he  said,  'where  might you  be coming from, and 
where might you be going  to?  Were you coming to visit' me? For, if so, you 
had gone past my gate without my seeing you.' 
     'Well, no, '  answered Pippin.  'To tell  you the truth, since  you have 
guessed  it, we got into the lane from the other end: we had come  over your  
fields. But that was quite by accident.  We  lost our way in the woods, back  
near Woodhall, trying to take a short cu t to the Ferry.' 
     'If you were  in a hurry,  the road would have served you better,' said 
the farmer. 'But I wasn't worrying about  that. You have  leave to walk over  
my land, if you have a  mind, Mr.  Peregrin. And you, Mr. Baggins  - though I 
daresay  you  still like mushrooms.'  He laughed.  'Ah yes, I recognized the 
name.  I recollect  the time when young Frodo  Baggins  was one of the worst  
young rascals of Buckland. But it  wasn't mushrooms I was thinking of. I had 
just heard the name Baggins before  you  turned up.  What do you think  that 
funny customer asked me?' 
     They  waited anxiously for  him to go on. 'Well,' the farmer continued, 
approaching his point with slow relish, 'he came riding on a big black horse 
in at  the  gate, which  happened  to be open, and right up to my door.  All 

####-black he was  himself, too, and cloaked and hooded up, as if he did not want 
to be known. "Now what  in the Shire  can  he want?" I thought to myself. We 
don't see many of the Big Folk over the border; and anywa y I had never heard 
of any like this black fellow. 
     ' "Good-day to you!" I says,  going  out to him. "This  lane don't lead 
anywhere,  and wherever  you may be going, your quickest way will be back to 
the road." I didn't like the looks of  him; and when  Grip came out, he took  
one sniff and  let out a  yelp as if he had been slung: he put down his tail 
and bolted off howling. The black fellow sat quite still. 
     ' "I come  from yonder," he  said,  slow  and stiff-like, pointing back  
west, over my  fields, if you please.  "Have you seen Baggins?" he asked in a  
queer voice,  and bent  down towards  me. I could not see any face,  for his 
hood fell down so low; and I felt a sort of shiver down  my back. But  I did 
not see why he should come riding over my land so bold. 
     ' "Be off!" I said. "There are no Bagginses  here.  You're in the wrong 
part of the Shire. You had better go back west to Hobbiton  - but you can  go 
by road this time." 
     ' "Baggins has  left,"  he answered in a whisper. "He is coming. He  is 
not far away. I wish to find him. If he passes will you tell me? I will come 
back with gold." 
     ' "No you won't," I said.  "You'll  go back  where you  belong,  double 
quick. I give you one minute before I call all my dogs." 
     'He gave a sort  of hiss. It might have been laughing, and it might not. 
Then he spurred  his great  horse right  at me, and I jumped  out of the way 
only just in time. I called the dogs, but he swung off, and rode through the 
gate  and up the lane  towards the causeway like a bolt  of thunder. What do  
you think of that?' 
     Frodo sat for a moment looking at  the fire,  but  his only thought was 
how on earth would they  reach the Ferry. 'I don't  know what  to think,' he 
said at last. 
     'Then I'll tell you what to think,' said Maggot. 'You should never have 
gone  mixing yourself up with Hobbiton folk, Mr. Frodo.  Folk  are queer  up 
there.'  Sam  stirred in  his  chair,  and  looked  at  the  farmer  with an 
unfriendly  eye. 'But you were always a  reckless lad. When  I heard you had 
left the Brandybucks  and  gone  off  to that old Mr. Bilbo, I said that you  
were going to find trouble. Mark my words, this  all comes of those  strange 
doings of Mr. Bilbo's. His money was got in some strange fashion  in foreign 

####-parts, they  say. Maybe there is some that want  to know what has  become of 
the gold and jewels that he buried in the hill of Hobbiton, as I hear?' 
     Frodo said  nothing:  the  shrewd  guesses of  the farmer  were  rather  
disconcerting. 
     'Well, Mr. Frodo,' Maggot went  on, 'I'm glad that you've had the sense 
to come back to Buckland. My  advice is: stay  there! And don't get mixed up 
with these outlandish folk.  You'll have  friends  in these parts. If any of 
these black  fellows come after you  again,  I'll  deal with  them. I'll say 
you're dead, or have left the Shire, or anything you like. And that might be 
true enough; for as like as not it is old Mr. Bilbo they want news of.' 
     'Maybe you're right,' said Frodo, avoiding the farmer's eye and staring 
at the fire. 
     Maggot looked at him thoughtfully. 'Well, I see  you have ideas of your 
own,' he said. 'It is as plain as my  nose that no  accident brought you and 
that rider here on the same afternoon; and maybe my  news was no  great news 
to you, after all.  I am not asking you to tell me anything you  have a mind 
to keep to yourself; but I see you are in some kind  of trouble. Perhaps you  
are thinking it won't be too easy to get to the Ferry without being caught?' 
     'I was thinking so,' said Frodo. 'But we have got to try and get there; 
and  it won't  be  done by sitting  and thinking. So I am afraid we must  be 
going.  Thank you very much indeed for your kindness! I've been in terror of 
you and your dogs for over thirty years, Farmer Maggot, though you may laugh 
to hear it. It's a pity: for I've missed a good friend. And now I'm sorry to 
leave so soon. But I'll come back, perhaps, one day  - if I get a chance.' 
     'You'll be welcome when you come,' said Maggot. 'But now I've a notion. 
It's near  sundown  already,  and we are going to  have our  supper; for  we 
mostly go to bed  soon after the Sun. If you and Mr. Peregrin and  all could 
stay and have a bite with us, we would be pleased!' 
     'And so should we!' said  Frodo. 'But  we  must  be going at once,  I'm 
afraid. Even now it will be dark before we can reach the Ferry.' 
     'Ah! but wait a minute! I was going to say: after a bit of supper, I'll 
gel out a small waggon,  and I'll drive you all to the Ferry. That will save 
you a good step, and it might also save you trouble of another sort.' 
     Frodo  now accepted the invitation gratefully, to the relief  of Pippin 
and  Sam. The sun  was  already behind the  western hills, and the light was 
failing.  Two  of  Maggot's  sons  and his  three  daughters came in, and  a  
generous  supper was  laid  on the large table.  The kitchen  was  lit  with 

####-candles and the fire was mended. Mrs. Maggot  hustled in and out. One or two 
other  hobbits  belonging to the farm-household came in.  In  a short  while 
fourteen  sat  down to eat. There  was beer in plenty,  and a mighty dish of 
mushrooms  and bacon, besides much other solid farmhouse fare. The  dogs lay 
by the fire and gnawed rinds and cracked bones. 
     When they had finished, the farmer and his sons went out with a lantern 
and got the waggon ready. It was dark in the yard, when the guests came out. 
They  threw their  packs  on board  and  climbed in. The farmer sat  in  the 
driving-seat,  and whipped up his two stout  ponies. His  wife stood  in the 
light of the open door. 
     'You  be  careful  of yourself. Maggot!' she called. 'Don't  go arguing 
with any foreigners, and come straight back!' 
     'I will!' said he, and drove out  of the gate. There was  now no breath 
of wind stirring; the night was still and quiet, and a chill was in the air. 
They went without  lights and took it  slowly. After  a mile or two the lane 
came to an end, crossing a deep dike,  and climbing a short slope up  on  to 
the high-banked causeway. 
     Maggot got down and took a good look  either way, north and  south, but 
nothing could  be  seen  in the darkness, and  there was not a sound in  the 
still  air.  Thin  strands  of river -mist  were hanging above the dikes, and 
crawling over the fields.  
     'It's going  to be thick,' said Maggot; 'but  I'll not light my lantern 
till I turn for home. We'll hear anything on the road long before we meet it 
tonight.' 
     It was five miles or more from Maggot's lane to the Ferry. The  hobbits 
wrapped themselves  up, but their ears were strained for any sound above the 
creak  of  the wheels and the  slow clop of  the ponies' hoofs.  The  waggon 
seemed slower than a snail to Frodo. Beside him  Pippin was  nodding towards 
sleep; but Sam was staring forwards into the rising fog. 
     They reached the  entrance to the Ferry lane at last. It was marked  by 
two tall white posts  that suddenly loomed up  on their right. Farmer Maggot 
drew  in his  ponies  and the  waggon creaked  to a  halt.  They  were  just 
beginning  lo scramble out, when suddenly they heard what  they had all been 
dreading: hoofs on the road ahead. The sound was coming towards them. 
     Maggot  jumped  down  and stood holding the  ponies' heads, and peering 
forward into the gloom. Clip-clop, clip-clop came the approaching rider. The 
fall of the hoofs sounded loud in the still, foggy air. 

####-     'You'd better be hidden, Mr. Frodo,' said  Sam anxiously. 'You get down 
in the waggon and cover up with  blankets, and we'll send this  rider to the 
rightabouts!'  He climbed out  and went to the  farmer's side.  Black Riders 
would have to ride over him to get near the waggon. 
     Clop-clop, clop-clop. The rider was nearly on them. 
     'Hallo there!' called Farmer Maggot. The advancing hoofs stopped short.  
They thought they could dimly guess a dark cloaked shape in the mist, a yard 
or two ahead. 'Now then!'  said the  farmer, throwing the  reins to  Sam and 
striding forward. 'Don't you come a step nearer! What do you want, and where 
are you going?' 
     'I want Mr. Baggins. Have you seen him?' sa id a muffled voice - but the 
voice was  the voice of Merry Brandybuck.  A dark lantern was uncovered, and 
its light fell on the astonished face of the farmer. 
     'Mr. Merry!' he cried. 
     'Yes, of course! Who  did you think it was?' said Merry coming forward.  
As  he came out of the mist and their fears subsided, he seemed suddenly  to 
diminish to  ordinary  hobbit-size. He was  riding a pony, and a  scarf  was 
swathed round his neck and over his chin to keep out the fog. 
     Frodo  sprang  out of  the waggon to greet  him. 'So  there you are  at 
last!'  said Merry.  'I was beginning to wonder if you would  turn up at all 
today, and I was just going back to supper. When it grew foggy I came across 
and rode up  towards Stock to see if you had fallen in  any ditches. But I'm 
blest  if  I  know  which way  you  have come. Where did you  find them, Mr. 
Maggot? In your duck-pond?' 
     'No,  I  caught 'em trespassing,'  said the farmer, 'and nearly set  my 
dogs on  'em;  but they'll tell  you all the story,  I 've no doubt.  Now, if 
you'll excuse  me, Mr. Merry and Mr. Frodo and  all, I'd best be turning for  
home. Mrs. Maggot will be worriting with the night getting thick.' 
     He backed the waggon into the lane and turned it. 'Well, good  night to 
you all,' he said. 'It's been a queer day, and no mistake. But all's well as 
ends well; though perhaps  we should not say  that  until  we reach  our own 
doors. I'll not deny that I'll be glad now when I  do.' He lit his lanterns,  
and got up.  Suddenly he produced a large basket from under the seat.  'I was 
nearly forgetting,' he said. 'Mrs. Maggot put this up  for Mr. Baggins, with 
her compliments.'  He handed  it down and moved off, followed by a chorus of 
thanks and good-nights. 
     They  watched  the  pale  rings  of  light  round his lanterns as  they 

####-dwindled  into  the  foggy night. Suddenly  Frodo laughed: from the  covered 
basket he held, the scent of mushrooms was rising. 
 

####- 

Chapter 5. A Conspiracy Unmasked 

 
 
     'Now we had  better get home  ourselves,' said  Merry. There's something 
funny about all this, I see; but it must wait till we get in.' 
     They turned down  the Ferry lane, which was straight and well-kept  and  
edged with  large white-washed stones. In a hundred yards  or so  it brought  
them to  the  river -bank,  where there was a broad wooden  landing-stage.  A 
large  flat  ferry-boat was  moored beside it.  The white  bollards near the 
water's edge glimmered in the light of two lamps on high posts. Behind  them 
the mists in the flat fields were now above the hedges; but the water before 
them was dark,  with only  a few curling wisps like steam among the reeds by 
the bank. There seemed to be less fog on the further side. 
     Merry  led the pony  over a gangway  on to  the ferry,  and the  others 
followed.  Merry  then  pushed slowly off with  a  long pole. The Brandywine 
flowed slow and broad before them. On the other side the bank was steep, and 
up it a  winding path climbed from the further landing. Lamps were twinkling 
there. Behind loomed  up the Buck Hill; and out of it, through stray shrouds 
of mist, shone many  round windows, yellow and red. They were the windows 
of 
Brandy Hall, the ancient home of the Brandybucks.  
     Long  ago Gorhendad Oldbuck,  head of the  Oldbuck family,  one of  the 
oldest  in  the Marish or indeed in the Shire, had crossed  the river, which 
was the original  boundary of  the land  eastwards. He built (and excavated)  
Brandy  Hall, changed his name to Brandybuck,  and settled  down  to  become 
master of  what was virtually  a small independent country. His  family grew 
and grew,  and after his days  continued to grow, until Brandy Hall occupied 
the whole of the low hill, and had three large front-doors, many side-doors,  
and about a hundred windows. The  Brandybucks and  their numerous 
dependants 
then  began  to burrow, and later to  build,  all round about. That was  the 
origin  of Buckland, a thickly inhabited strip between the river and the Old 
Forest, a sort  of colony from the Shire. Its  chief village was Bucklebury, 
clustering in the banks and slopes behind Brandy Hall. 
     The people in the Marish were  friendly with the Bucklanders,  and  the 
authority of the Master  of the  Hall (as the head of the Brandybuck  family 

####-was called) was still acknowledged by the farmers between Stock  and Rushey. 
But  most of the folk of the old Shire regarded the Bucklanders as peculiar, 
half foreigners as it were. Though, as a matter  of fact, they were not very 
different from the other hobbits of the Four Farthings. Except in one point: 
they were fond of boats, and some of them could swim. 
     Their land  was originally unprotected from the East; but on  that side 
they had built a hedge: the High Hay. It had been  planted many  generations 
ago, and was now thick and  tail, for it  was constantly tended. It  ran all 
the  way from Brandywine Bridge, in a big loop  curving away from the river, 
to  Haysend  (where  the  Withywindle flowed  out  of  the Forest  into  the 
Brandywine): well over twenty miles from end to  end. But, of course,  it was 
not  a complete  protection.  The Forest  drew  close  to the hedge in  many 
places.  The Bucklanders kept their doors locked after  dark,  and that also 
was not usual in the Shire. 
     The  ferry-boat moved slowly  across the water. The Buckland shore drew 
nearer. Sam was the only member of the party who had not been over the river  
before. He had a strange feeling as the slow gurgling stream slipped by: his 
old life lay behind  in the mists, dark adventure lay in front. He scratched 
his head, and for a moment had a passing wish that Mr. Frodo could have gone 
on living quietly at Bag End. 
     The four  hobbits stepped off the ferry.  Merry was  tying  it up,  and 
Pippin  was already leading  the pony up the  path, when Sam  (who had  been 
looking ba ck, as if to take farewell of the Shire) said in a hoarse whisper: 
     'Look back, Mr. Frodo! Do you see anything?' 
     On the far stage, under the distant lamps, they could just  make  out a  
figure: it looked like a  dark black bundle left behind. But a s they  looked 
it seemed to move and sway this way and that, as if searching the ground. It  
then crawled, or went crouching, back into the gloom beyond the lamps.  
     'What in the Shire is that?' exclaimed Merry. 
     'Something that is following us,' said Frodo. 'But don't ask  any  more 
now!  Let's get away  at once!' They hurried up the path to the top  of  the 
bank,  but when  they  looked  back  the far shore was shrouded in mist, and 
nothing could be seen. 
     'Thank goodness you don't keep any boats on the west -bank!' said Frodo.  
'Can horses cross the river?' 
     'They  can go twenty miles north to Brandywine  Bridge - or they  might 
swim,'  answered  Merry. 'Though  I  never heard of any horse  swimming  the 

####-Brandywine. But what have  horses to do with it?' I'll tell you later. Let's 
get indoors and then we can talk.' 
     'All right! You and Pippin know your way; so I'll just ride on and tell 
Fatty Bolger that you are coming. We'll see about supper and things.' 
     'We had our supper early with Farmer Maggot,' said Frodo;  'but we could 
do with another.' 
     'You shall have it! Give  me that basket!' said  Merry, and  rode ahead 
into the darkness.  
     It  was some distance from  the  Brandywine  to  Frodo's new  house  at 
Crickhollow. They passed Buck Hill and Brandy Hall on their left, and on the 
outskirts of Bucklebury struck the main road of Buckland that ran south from 
the Bridge. Half a mile northward  along this they came to a lane opening on  
their  right. This they followed for a couple of miles as it  climbed up and 
down into the country. 
     At last  they  came to a narrow gate in a thick hedge. Nothing could be 
seen  of the house in the dark: it stood back from the lane in the middle of 
a wide  circle of  lawn surrounded by  a belt of  low trees inside the outer  
hedge. Frodo had chosen it, because it stood in an  out-of-the-way corner of 
the country, and there were  no other dwellings close  by.  You could get in 
and out  without being noticed. It had been built a long while before by the 
Brandybucks, for the use  of guests, or members of the family that wished to 
escape  from  the  crowded  life  of  Brandy  Hall  for a  time.  It  was an 
old-fashioned  countrified house, as much like a hobbit -hole as possible: it 
was long and low,  with no  upper storey; and it had a roof  of  turf, round 
windows, and a large round door. 
     As they walked lip the green path  from  the gate no light was visible; 
the  windows  were dark and shuttered.  Frodo knocked on the door, and Fatty 
Bolger opened it . A friendly light streamed out. They slipped in quickly and 
shut themselves and the light inside. They were in a wide hall with doors on 
either side; in  front  of them a  passage ran back  down the  middle of the 
house. 
     'Well, what do you think of it?' asked Merry coming up the passage. 'We 
have  done our  best in  a short time to make it  look  like home. After all 
Fatty and I only got here with the last cart-load yesterday.' 
     Frodo looked  round.  It did  look like home. Many of his own favourite 
things -  or Bilbo's things (they  reminded  him sharply of him in their new 
selling) - were arranged as nearly as possible as they had been  at Bag End. 

####-It  was  a  pleasant,  comfortable,  welcoming  place;  and he found himself 
wishing  that he was really coming  here to settle down in quiet retirement. 
It  seemed unfair  to have put his friends  to  all  this  trouble;  and  he 
wondered again how he was going to break the news to them that he must leave 
them so soon, indeed at  once. Yet that  would  have  to be  done  that very 
night, before they all went to bed. 
     'It's delightful!' he said with an effort. 'I  hardly feel that I  have 
moved at all.' 
     The  travellers hung  up their  cloaks,  and piled  their packs  on the 
floor. Merry led them down the passage and threw open a door at the far end. 
Firelight came out, and a puff of steam. 
     'A bath!' cried Pippin. 'O blessed Meriadoc!' 
     'Which order  shall we  go in?' said Frodo. 'Eldest  first, or quickest 
first? You'll be last either way, Master Peregrin.' 
     'Trust me to arrange things  better than that!'  said Merry.  'We can't 
begin life  at Crickhollow with a quarrel over baths. In that room there are 
three tubs, and  a copper full of boiling water. There are also towels, mats 
and soap. Get inside, and be quick!' 
     Merry and Fatty went into the kitchen on the other side of the passage, 
and  busied  themselves  with  the  final  preparations  for  a late supper. 
Snatches of competing songs came  from the bathroom mixed  with the sound 
of 
splashing and wallowing.  The voice of Pippin was  suddenly lifted up  above 
the others in one of Bilbo's favourite bath-songs. 
     Sing hey! for the bath at close of day 
     that washes the weary mud away! 
     A loon is he that will not sing: 
     O! Water Hot is a noble thing! 
 
     O! Sweet is the sound of falling rain, 
     and the brook that leaps from hill to plain; 
     but better than rain or rippling streams 
     is Water Hot that smokes and steams. 
 
     O! Water cold we may pour at need 
     down a thirsty throat and be glad indeed; 
     but better is Beer, if drink we lack, 

####-     and Water Hot poured down the back. 
 
     O! Water is fair that leaps on high 
     in a fountain white beneath the sky; 
     but never did fountain sound so sweet 
     as splashing Hot Water with my feet! 
     There  was a terrific  splash, and  a  shout  of  Whoa! from  Frodo. It 
appeared that a lot of Pippin's  bath had imitated a fountain and leaped  on 
high. 
     Merry went  to the door: 'What about supper a nd beer in the throat?' he 
called. Frodo came out drying his hair. 
     'There's so much  water  in the air that I'm coming into the kitchen to 
finish,' he said. 
     'Lawks!' said Merry, looking  in. The  stone floor  was swimming.  'You  
ought to mop all that up before you get anything to eat. Peregrin,' he said. 
'Hurry up, or we shan't wait for you.' 
     They had supper in the kitchen on a table near the fire. 'I suppose you  
three won't want mushrooms again?' said Fredegar without much hope. 
     'Yes we shall!' cried Pippin. 
     'They're mine!'  said Frodo. 'Given to me  by Mrs. Maggot, a queen among 
farmers' wives. Take your greedy hands away, and I'll serve them.' 
     Hobbits have a passion  for mushrooms,  surpassing  even  the greediest  
likings  of Big  People.  A  fact  which  partly explains young Frodo's long 
expeditions  to  the renowned fields of the Marish,  and the  wrath  of  the 
injured Maggot. On this occasion there was plenty for all, even according to 
hobbit standards. There were also many other things to follow, and when they 
had  finished even Fatty Bolger heaved  a sigh  of content. They pushed back 
the table, and drew chairs round the fire. 
     'We'll clear up later,' said Merry. 'Now tell me all  about it! I guess 
that you have been having adventures, which was not quite fair without me. I 
want a full account; and most of all I want to know what was the matter with 
old Maggot, and why he spoke to me like that. He sounded almost as if he was 
scared, if that is possible.' 
     'We  have all been  scared,' said Pippin after a pause,  in which Frodo 
stared at the fire and did not speak. 'You would have been,  too, if you had 
been chased for two days by Black Riders.' 
     'And what are they?' 

####-     'Black figures  riding  on black horses,'  answered Pippin.  'If  Frodo 
won't talk, I will tell you the whole tale from the beginning.' He then gave 
a  full account of their journey from the time  when they left Hobbiton. Sam 
gave various supporting nods and exclamations. Frodo remained silent. 
     'I should  think you were making it all up,'  said Merry, 'if I had not 
seen  that black shape on  the landing-stage - and heard the queer  sound in 
Maggot's voice. What do you make of it all, Frodo?' 
     'Cousin Frodo has been very close,' said Pippin. 'But the time has come 
for  him to open  out. So far we have been given nothing  more to go on than 
Farmer  Maggot's  guess  that  it  has  something  to  do  with  old Bilbo's 
treasure.' 
     'That  was  only  a  guess,' said Frodo hastily. 'Maggot does  not know 
anything.' 
     'Old Maggot is  a shrewd fellow,' said Merry. 'A lot goes on behind his 
round face that does not come out in his talk. I've heard that he used to go 
into the Old Forest at one time, and he has the reputation of knowing a good 
many  strange things. But you can at least tell us, Frodo, whether you think  
his guess good or bad.' 
     'I think,'  answered Frodo slowly, 'that it was a good guess, as  far as 
it  goes. There is a  connexion with Bilbo's  old adventures,  and the Riders 
are looking,  or perhaps one  ought to say  searching,  for him or for me. I 
also fear, if you want to know, that it is no joke at all; and that I am not 
safe here or anywhere else.' He looked round at the windows and walls, as if 
he was afraid  they would  su ddenly give  way.  The others looked at him  in 
silence, and exchanged meaning glances among themselves. 
     'It's coming out in a minute,' whispered Pippin to Merry. Merry nodded. 
     'Well!' said Frodo at  last, sitting  up and straightening his back, as 
if he had made  a  decision.  'I can't keep it dark any  longer.  I have got 
something to tell you all. But I don't know quite how to begin.' 
     'I think I could help you,' said Merry quietly, 'by telling you some of 
it myself.' 
     'What do you mean?' said  Frodo, looking  at him anxiously. 'Just this, 
my  dear old  Frodo: you  are miserable, because you don't know how  to  say 
good-bye.  You  meant to leave the Shire, of course. But danger has come  on 
you sooner  than you expected, and now you are  making up your mind to go at 
once. And you don't want to. We are very sorry for you.' 
     Frodo opened his mouth  and shut it again. His  look of surprise was so 

####-comical that they laughed. 'Dear  old  Frodo!' said Pippin.  'Did you really 
think you had thrown dust in  all our eyes? You have not been nearly careful 
or clever enough for that! You have obviously been planning to go and saying 
farewell  to  all your haunts all this  year since April. We have constantly 
heard you  muttering:  "Shall  I  ever   look  down into that valley again, I 
wonder",  and things like that.  And pretending that you had come to the end  
of  your  money,  and  actually  selling  your  beloved  Bag  End  to  those 
Sackville-Bagginses! And all those close talks with Gandalf.' 
     'Good  heavens!'  said Frodo. 'I thought  I had been  both  careful and 
clever. I don't know what Gandalf would say. Is all  the Shire discussing my  
departure then?' 
     'Oh no!' said Merry. 'Don't worry about that! The secret won't keep for  
long,  of  course;  but  at  present it  is,  I  think,  only  known  to  us 
conspirators. After  all, you must remember  that we know you  well, and are 
often with  you.  We can usually guess what you are thinking. I  knew Bilbo,  
too. To  tell you the truth,  I had been watching you  rather  closely  ever  
since he  left. I thought you would go  after him sooner or  later; indeed I 
expected you  to go sooner, and lately we have  been very  anxious.  We have 
been terrified that you might give us the slip, and go off suddenly,  all on 
your own like he did. Ever since this spring we have kept our eyes open, and  
done a good deal of planning on our own account. You are not going to escape 
so easily!' 
     'But I must go,' said Frodo. 'It cannot be helped, dear friends. It  is 
wretched for us all, but it is no use your trying to keep me. Since you have 
guessed so much, please help me and do not hinder me!' 
     'You  do not understand!' said Pippin. 'You  must go  - and therefore we 
must, too. Merry and I are coming with you. Sam is an excellent fellow,  and 
would jump down a dragon's throat to  save you, if he did not trip over  his 
own feet; but  you  will  need  more than one  companion in  your  dangerous 
adventure.' 
     'My dear  and  most beloved hobbits!'  said Frodo deeply  moved. 'But I 
could not  allow it. I decided that  long ago, too. You speak of danger, but 
you do not understand. This is no treasure-hunt,  no there-and -back journey.  
I am flying from deadly peril into deadly peril.' 
     'Of course  we understand,'  said Merry  firmly.  'That is why we  have 
decided to come. We know the Ring is no laughing-matter; but we are going to 
do our best to help you against the Enemy.' 

####-     'The Ring!' said Frodo, now completely amazed. 
     'Yes, the Ring,' said  Merry. 'My dear old hobbit, you don't  allow for  
the inquisitiveness of friends. I have known about the existence of the Ring 
for years  - before Bilbo went away, in fact; but since he obviously regarded 
it  as  secret,  I  kept  the  knowledge  in  my  head, until we formed  our 
conspiracy. I  did not know Bilbo, of course, as  well as I know you; I  was 
too young, and he was also more careful  - but  he was not careful enough. If 
you want to know how I first found out, I will tell you.' 
     'Go on!' said Frodo faintly. 
     'It was  the  Sackville-Bagginses that were his downfall,  as you might 
expect. One day, a year before the Party, I happened to be walking along the  
road, when I  saw Bilbo ahead. Suddenly in the distance the S.-B.s appeared, 
coming towards us.  Bilbo slowed down, and then hey presto! he  vanished.  I 
was so startled that I hardly had the wits to hide myself in a more ordinary 
fashion; but  I got through the hedge and walked along the  field inside.  I 
was  peeping  through into the road,  after the S.-B.s  had  passed, and was 
looking  straight at Bilbo  when he suddenly reappeared. I caught a glint of 
gold as he put something back in his trouser -pocket. 
     'After that I kept my  eyes open.  In fact, I confess that I spied. But 
you must  admit that it was very  intriguing, and I was only in my teens.  I 
must be the only one in the Shire, besides you Frodo, that has ever seen the 
old fellow's secret book.' 
     'You have read his book!' cried Frodo.  'Good heavens above! Is nothing 
safe?' 
     'Not  too safe, I should say,' said  Merry.  'But  I have  only had one 
rapid glance, and that was difficult to get. He never left the book about. I 
wonder what became  of it. I should  like  another look.  Have you  got  it, 
Frodo?' 
     'No. It was not at Bag End. He must have taken it away.' 
     'Well, as  I  was saying,' Merry  proceeded, 'I  kept my  knowledge  to 
myself,  till  this Spring  when  things got  serious. Then  we  formed  our 
conspiracy;  and  as we were serious, too,  and meant business,  we have not  
been too scrupulous. You are  not a very easy  nut to crack,  and Gandalf is 
worse. But if  you want to be  introduced  to our chief investigator, I  can 
produce him.' 
     'Where is  he?' said  Frodo, looking round, as if he  expected a masked 
and sinister figure to come out of a cupboard. 

####-     'Step forward, Sam!'  said Merry; and  Sam stood up with a face scarlet 
up to  the ears.  'Here's our collector of  information! And he  collected a  
lot, I  can tell you, before he was finally  caught. After which, I may say, 
he seemed to regard himself as on parole, and dried up.' 
     'Sam!' cried  Frodo,  feeling that amazement could  go no  further, and 
quite  unable  to decide whether he felt angry,  amused, relieved, or merely 
foolish. 
     'Yes, sir!' said Sam.  'Begging your pardon, sir! But I meant  no wrong 
to you, Mr.  Frodo, nor to Mr. Gandalf  for that matter. He  has some sense, 
mind you; and when you  said  go alone, he  said no! lake someone as you can 
trust.' 
     'But it does not seem that I can trust anyone,' said Frodo.  Sam looked 
at him unhappily.  'It all depends on what you want,' put in Merry. 'You can 
trust us to stick to you through thick and thin - to the bitter end. And you  
can trust us to keep any secret of yours  - closer than you keep it yourself.  
But you cannot trust us to let you face trouble alone, and go off  without a  
word. We  are your friends, Frodo. Anyway: there it is. We know most of what 
Gandalf has  told you. We know  a good deal about the Ring. We  are horribly 
afraid - but we are coming with you; or following you like hounds.' 
     'And after all, sir,'  added Sam,  'you did  ought to  take the  Elves' 
advice.  Gildor said you should take them as was willing, and you can't deny 
it.' 
     'I don't deny it,' said Frodo, looking at Sam, who was now grinning. 'I 
don't  deny it, but I'll never believe you  are  sleeping again, whether you  
snore or not. I shall kick you hard to make sure. 
     'You are a set  of deceitful  scoundrels!'  he  said,  turning  to  the 
others.  'But bless you!' he laughed, getting up and waving his arms, 'I give 
in. I will take Gildor's  advice.  If the danger were not  so dark, I should 
dance for joy. Even so,  I cannot  help feeling  happy; happier than I  have 
felt for a long time. I had dreaded this evening.' 
     'Good!  That's  settled. Three cheers  for  Captain Frodo and company!' 
they shouted;  and  they  danced round him. Merry and  Pippin  began a song, 
which they had apparently got ready for the occasion. 
     It was made on  the model of the dwarf-song that started Bilbo  on  his 
adventure long ago, and went to the same tune: 
     Farewell we call to hearth and hall! 
     Though wind may blow and rain may fall, 

####-     We must away ere break of day 
     Far over wood and mountain tall. 
 
     To Rivendell, where Elves yet dwell 
     In glades beneath the misty fell, 
     Through moor and waste we ride in haste, 
     And whither then we cannot tell. 
 
     With foes ahead, behind us dread, 
     Beneath the sky shall be our bed, 
     Until at last our toil be passed, 
     Our journey done, our errand sped. 
 
     We must away! We must away! 
     We ride before the break of day! 
     'Very good!' said Frodo. 'But in that case there are a lot of things to 
do before we go to bed - under a roof, for  tonight at any rate.' 
     'Oh! That was poetry!' said Pippin. 'Do you really mean to start before 
the break of day?' 
     'I don't know,' answered  Frodo. 'I fear those  Black Riders, and  I am 
sure it is unsafe to stay in one place long, especially in  a place to which 
it is known  I was going. Also Gildor advised me  not to wait. But I  should 
very  much like  to see  Gandalf. I could see that even Gildor was disturbed 
when  he heard that Gandalf  had never  appeared. It really  depends  on two 
things.  How soon could the Riders get to Bucklebury? And how  soon could 
we 
get off? It will take a good deal of preparation.' 
     'The answer to the  second question,' said Merry, 'is that we could get 
off in an hour. I have prepared practically everything. There are six ponies 
in a stable across the fields; stores and tackle are all packed, except  for  
a few extra clothes, and the perishable food.' 
     'It seems to have been  a  very efficient conspiracy,' said Frodo. 'But 
what about the Black Riders? Would it be safe to wait one day for Gandalf?' 
     'That all depends on  what you think the Riders would do, if they found 
you here,' answered Merry. 'They could  have reached here  by now, of course, 
if they were not stopped at the North-gate, where the Hedge runs down to the 
river -bank, just this side of the Bridge. The gate-guards would not let them 

####-through by night, though they might break through. Even in the daylight they 
would try  to keep them out, I think, at any  rate until  they got a message 
through to the Master of the Hall  - for they would not like the  look of the 
Riders, and would certainly be  frightened by them. But, of course, Buckland 
cannot resist a determined attack for  long. And it  is possible that in the 
morning even a Black Rider that rode  up  and asked for Mr. Baggins would be 
let through. It is pretty generally known that you are coming back  to  live 
at Crickhollow.' 
     Frodo  sat for  a while in thought. 'I have made  up  my mind,' he said 
finally. 'I am starting tomorrow, as soon as it is light. But I am not going 
by road: it  would be safer  to  wait here than  that.  If  I go through the 
North-gate my departure from  Buckland  will  be  known at once, instead  of 
being secret for  several days at least,  as it might be. And  what is more, 
the Bridge and the  East Road  near the  borders  will certainly be watched, 
whether  any Rider gets into  Buckland or not. We don't know  how many there 
are; but there are at least  two, and possibly more. The only thing to do is 
to go off in a qu ite unexpected direction.' 
     'But that  can only mean going  into  the  Old  Forest!'  said Fredegar 
horrified. 'You can't be thinking of doing that. It is quite as dangerous as 
Black Riders.' 
     'Not quite,' said Merry. It sounds very  desperate, but I believe Frodo 
is right. It is the only way of getting off without being followed  at once. 
With luck we might gel a considerable start.' 
     'But you won't have any luck in the Old Forest,' objected Fredegar. 'No 
one ever has luck in there. You'll gel lost. People don't go in there.' 
     'Oh yes they  do!'  said  Merry. 'The Brandybucks go in   - occasionally 
when the fit takes  them. We have  a  private entrance. Frodo  went in once, 
long ago. I have been in several times: usually in daylight, of course, when 
the trees are sleepy and fairly quiet.' 
     'Well, do  as you think best!' said Fredegar. 'I am more afraid of  the 
Old  Forest  than of anything I  know about:  the  stories  about  it  are a  
nightmare; but  my  vote hardly counts,  as I am  not going on the  journey. 
Still, I am very glad  someone is stopping behind, who can tell Gandalf what 
you have done, when he turns up, as I am sure he will before long.' 
     Fond as he was of Frodo, Fatty Bolger had no desire to leave the Shire, 
nor to see what lay  outside it. His family came from the Eastfarthing, from 
Budgeford in Bridgefields in fact, but he had never been over the Brandywine 

####-Bridge.  His task, according to the original plans  of the conspirators, was 
to stay  behind and deal with inquisitive folk,  and  to keep up as long  as 
possible the  pretence that Mr. Baggins  was still living at Crickhollow. He 
had even brought along some old clothes of  Frodo's to help  him  in playing  
the part. They little thought how dangerous that part might prove. 
     'Excellent!' said Frodo,  when he understood the  plan. 'We  could  not  
have  left  any  message behind for Gandalf otherwise.  I don't know whether 
these Riders can read or not, of course, but I should not have dared to risk  
a written message, in case they got in and  searched the house. But if Fatty 
is willing to hold the fort, and I can be sure of Gandalf knowing the way we 
have gone, that  decides me. I am going  into  the Old  Forest  first  thing 
tomorrow.' 
     'Well, that's that,' said Pippin. 'On the whole I would rather have our 
job than Fatty's - waiting here till Black Riders come.' 
     'You wait till you are well inside  the Forest,' said Fredegar. 'You'll 
wish you were back here with me before this time tomorrow.' 
     'It's no  good arguing about it any more,' said Merry.  'We have  still 
got  to tidy up and put the finishing touches to  the packing, before we get 
to bed. I shall call you all before the break of day.' 
     When at last he  had got to bed, Frodo could not sleep for  some  time. 
His  legs ached. He. was  glad that he was riding in the morning. Eventually 
he fell into a  vague dream, in which he seemed to be looking  out of a high 
window over  a dark  sea of tangled trees.  Down below among the roots there 
was the sound of creatures  crawling and snuffling.  He felt sure they would  
smell him out sooner or later. 
     Then  he heard a noise in the distance.  At first he thought  it  was a  
great wind  coming over the leaves of the forest. Then  he knew  that it was 
not leaves, but the sound of the  Sea far-off; a sound he had never heard in 
waking life, though it  had often  troubled his dreams. Suddenly he found he 
was out in the open. There were no trees after all. He was on  a dark heath, 
and there was a strange salt smell in  the air. Looking up he saw before him 
a tall white tower, standing alone on a high ridge. A great desire came over  
him to climb the tower and see the Sea. He started to struggle  up the ridge 
towards the  tower:  but  suddenly a light came in  the sky, and there was a  
noise of thunder. 
 
 

####-<h4>Chapter 6.</h4> <br> The Old Forest 

 
 
     Frodo woke suddenly. It was still dark in  the room. Merry was standing 
there with a candle  in one hand, and banging  on the  door with the  other. 
'All right! What is it?' said Frodo, still shaken and bewildered. 
     'What is it!' cried Merry. 'It is  time to get up. It is half past four 
and very foggy. Come on! Sam is already getting breakfast ready. Even Pippin 
is up. I am just going to saddle the ponies, and fetch the one that is to be 
the  baggage-carrier. Wake that sluggard Fatty! At least he must get up  and  
see us off.' 
     Soon after  six o'clock the  five  hobbits were  ready  to start. Fatty 
Bolger was still yawning. They stole quietly out of the house. Merry went in 
front leading a laden pony, and took his way along a path that  went through 
a spinney behind  the house, and then  cut across several fields. The leaves 
of  trees were  glistening, and every twig  was dripping; the grass was grey 
with  cold dew. Everything was  still,  and far-away  noises seemed near and 
clear:  fowls chattering  in a yard,  someone closing a  door of  a  distant 
house. 
     In their shed they found the ponies;  sturdy  little beasts of the kind 
loved by hobbits, not speedy, but good for  a long day's work. They mounted, 
and  soon  they  were  riding off  into  the  mist,  which  seemed  to  open 
reluctantly before them and close forbiddingly behind them. After riding for  
about  an  hour,  slowly  and without talking,  they  saw  the Hedge looming  
suddenly ahead. It was tall and netted over  with silver cobwebs.  'How  are 
you  going to get  through  this?'  asked Fredegar. 'Follow me!' said Merry, 
'and you will see.' He turned to the  left  along  the Hedge, and  soon they 
came to a point  wher e it bent inwards, running along the lip of a hollow. A 
cutting  had been made, at  some distance from the  Hedge, and  went sloping 
gently down into the ground. It had walls of brick at  the sides, which rose 
steadily,  until suddenly  they arched  over a nd formed a  tunnel that dived 
deep under the Hedge and came out in the hollow on the other side. 
     Here Fatty Bolger halted. 'Good-bye, Frodo!' he  said.  'I wish you were 
not going into the Forest. I only hope you will not need rescuing before the 
day is out. But good luck to you - today and every day!' 
     'If there  are no worse things ahead  than  the Old Forest, I  shall be 
lucky,'  said  Frodo. 'Tell Gandalf to hurry along the  East Road: we  shall 

####-soon be back on it and going as fast as we can.'  'Good-bye!' they cried, and 
rode down the slope and disappeared from Fredegar's sight into the tunnel. 
     It  was  dark and  damp. At the far  end it  was  closed  by  a gate of 
thick -set iron bars. Merry got down and unlocked the gate, and when they had 
all passed through he pushed it to again. It shut with a clang, and the lock  
clicked. The sound was ominous. 
     'There!' said Merry. 'You have left the Shire, and are now outside, and 
on the edge of the Old Forest.' 
     'Are the stories about it true?' asked Pippin. 
     'I don't know what  stories you mean,' Merry answered. 'If you mean the 
old bogey-stories Fatty's nurses  used to tell him, about goblins and wolves 
and things of that sort, I should say no. At any rate I  don't believe them. 
But the  Forest is queer. Everything in it  is very  much more  alive,  more 
aware of what is going on, so to  speak, than things  are in the  Shire. And 
the  trees do not like strangers. They watch  you. They  are usually content 
merely to  watch  you,  as  long  a s  daylight  lasts,  and  don't  do much. 
Occasionally the most unfriendly ones may drop a  branch,  or  stick  a root 
out,  or grasp at you with a long trailer. But at  night things  can be most  
alarming,  or so I am  told. I have  only once or twice  been in here  after  
dark, and then only near the hedge. I thought all the  trees were whispering 
to each  other,  passing news and plots along in an unintelligible language; 
and the branches swayed and groped without any wind. They  do  say the trees 
do  actually move, and can surround strangers and hem them in. In  fact long  
ago they  attacked the Hedge: they came and  planted themselves right by it,  
and leaned over it. But the hobbits came and cut down hundreds of trees, and 
made a great  bonfire in the  Forest, and  burned all the  ground in  a long 
strip east of the Hedge. After that the  trees gave up the attack,  but they 
became very unfriendly.  There  is  still a wide  bare  space not far inside 
where the bonfire was made.' 
     'Is it only the trees that are dangerous?' asked Pippin. 
     'There are  various queer things living deep  in the Forest, and on the 
far  side,' said Merry, 'or at least I have heard so; but I have never  seen 
any of them. But something makes paths. Whenever  one comes inside one 
finds 
open tracks; but they seem to shift and change from time  to time in a queer 
fashion.  Not far from  this tunnel there is, or was for  a  long time,  the 
beginning of quite  a broad path leading to the Bonfire  Glade,  and then on 

####-more  or less in our direction, east and a little  north. That is the path I 
am going to try and find.' 
     The hobbits now left the tunnel -gate and rode across  the  wide hollow.  
On the far side was a faint path leading up on to the floor of the Forest, a  
hundred yards a nd more beyond  the Hedge;  but it  vanished  as  soon as  it 
brought them under the trees.  Looking back they could see the  dark line of 
the  Hedge  through  the stems of trees  that were already thick about them. 
Looking  ahead  they  could  see  only tree-trunks of innumerable sizes  and  
shapes: straight  or bent,  twisted, leaning,  squat  or slender, smooth  or  
gnarled and branched;  and all the stems were green  or grey with  moss  and  
slimy, shaggy growths.  
     Merry alone  seemed fairly cheerful.  'You had  better lead  on and find 
that path,'  Frodo  said to him.  'Don't  let us lose one another, or forget 
which way the Hedge lies!' 
     They picked a  way  among the trees, and  their  ponies plodded  along, 
carefully  avoiding the many  writhing  and interlacing roots. There  was no 
undergrowth. The ground was  rising  steadily,  and as they went  forward it  
seemed  that the trees became  taller, darker,  and  thicker. There  was  no 
sound,  except  an occasional drip  of  moisture falling  through  the still 
leaves.  For  the  moment  there  was no  whispering  or movement  among the 
branches; but  they  all got  an uncomfortable feeling that they were  being 
watched with disapproval, deepening to dislike and even enmity.  The feeling 
steadily  grew, until they found  themselves looking up quickly, or glancing 
back over their shoulders, as if they expected a sudden blow.  
     There was not  as  yet  any  sign  of  a path,  and  the  trees  seemed 
constantly to bar their way. Pippin suddenly  felt that he could not bear it 
any longer, and without warning let out  a shout. 'Oi! Oi!' he  cried. 'I am 
not going to do anything. Just let me pass through, will you!' 
     The others halted startled; but the  cry  fell as if muffled by a heavy 
curtain. There was no echo or answer though the wood  seemed to  become 
more 
crowded and more watchful than before. 
     'I should not shout, if I were you,' said Merry. It does more harm than 
good.' 
     Frodo began to wonder if it were possible to find a way through, a nd if 
he had been right  to make  the others come into this abominable wood. Merry 
was looking from side to side, and seemed already uncertain which way to go. 

####-Pippin noticed it. 'It  has not taken you long to lose  us,' he said. But at 
that moment Merry gave a whistle of relief and pointed ahead. 
     'Well, well!'  he  said. 'These trees do  shift.  There is the  Bonfire 
Glade in front of  us (or I hope so), but the path to it seems to have moved 
away!' 
     The light grew clearer as they  went forward. Suddenly they came out of 
the trees and found themselves in a wide circular space. There was sky above 
them, blue and clear to  their surprise, for down under the Forest -roof they 
had not been able to see the rising morning and the lifting of the mist. The 
sun  was  not,  however,  high  enough  yet to shine down into the clearing, 
though its light was on  the  tree-tops. The  leaves  were  all  thicker and 
greener about  the edges of  the  glade, enclosing  it with  an almost solid 
wall. No tree grew there,  only rough grass and many tall plants: stalky  and 
faded hemlocks  and wood-parsley,  fire-weed seeding into fluffy ashes,  and 
rampant nettles and  thistles.  A dreary place: but it seemed a charming and 
cheerful garden after the close Forest. 
     The hobbits  felt encouraged, and looked up hopefully at the broadening 
daylight in the  sky. At the far side  of the glade there was a break in the 
wall of trees, and a clear path beyond it. They could see it running on into 
the wood, wide  in places  and open  above, though  every  now and again the 
trees drew in and overshadowed it with their dark boughs. Up this path  they 
rode. They were  still climbing gently, but they now  went much quicker, and 
with better heart;  for it seemed to them that the  Forest had relented, and 
was going to let them pass unhindered after all. 
     But after a while the air began to get  hot and stuffy. The  trees drew 
close again  on either side, and they  could  no longer  see far ahead.  Now 
stronger than ever they  felt again  the ill will  of  the  wood pressing on 
them.  So silent was it that  the fall of their ponies'  hoofs, rustling  on 
dead leaves and  occasionally  stumbling on hidden roots, seemed to thud  in 
their ears. Frodo tried to sing a song to encourage them, but his voice sank  
to a murmur. 
     O! Wanderers in the shadowed land 
     despair not! For though dark they stand, 
     all woods there be must end at last, 
     and see the open sun go past: 
     the setting sun, the rising sun, 
     the day's end, or the day begun. 

####-     For east or west all woods must fail... 
     Fail - even as he said the word his voice faded  into  silence. The air 
seemed  heavy and the making  of  words wearisome. Just behind them  a large 
branch fell from an  old overhanging tree with  a crash into  the  path. The 
trees seemed to close in before them. 
     'They  do not  like all that about ending and failing,' said  Merry. 'I  
should not sing any  more  at present. Wait till we do  get to the edge, and 
then we'll turn and give them a rousing chorus!' 
     He spoke cheerfully, and if  he felt any great anxiety, he did not show 
it. The  others did not  answer.  They were depressed.  A heavy  weight  was 
settling steadily  on  Frodo's  heart, and he regretted now with every  step 
forward that he had ever thought of challenging the menace  of the trees. He 
was, indeed,  just  about  to stop and propose going back (if that was still 
possible), when  things took  a  new  turn. The  path  stopped climbing, and 
became for a while nearly  level. The dark trees drew aside, and  ahead they 
could see  the path  going  almost  straight forward.  Before them, but some 
distance off, there stood a  green  hill-top, treeless, rising  like a  bald 
head out of the  encircling wood. The  path seemed to be making directly for  
it. 
     They now hurried forward again,  delighted with the thought of climbing 
out  for  a  while above the roof  of the Forest. The path dipped, and  then 
again began  to climb upwards, leading them at last to the foot of the steep 
hillside.  There  it left the trees and faded into the turf.  The wood stood 
all round the hill like  thick  hair that ended sharply in  a circle round a  
shaven crown. 
     The hobbits  led their  ponies up, winding  round and  round until they 
reached the top. There they stood and gazed about them. The air was gleaming 
and sunlit, but hazy; and they could not see to any great distance. Near  at 
hand the mist was now almost gone;  though here and there it lay  in hollows 
of the wood, and to  the south  of  them, out of a deep  fold cutting  right 
across the Forest, the fog still rose like steam or wisps of white smoke. 
     'That,'  said Merry, pointing  with his hand, 'that  is the line of the 
Withywindle. It comes down out of the Downs and flows south-west through 
the 
midst of the  Forest to join the  Brandywine below Haysend. We don't want to 
go that way! The Withywindle valley is said to be  the  queerest part of the 
whole wood  - the centre from which all the queerness comes, as it were.' 

####-     The others looked in the  direction  that  Merry  pointed out, but they 
could see little but mists over the damp and  deep-cut valley; and beyond it 
the southern half of the Forest faded from view.  
     The sun on the hill-lop was now  getting  hot. It must  have been a bout 
eleven o'clock; but the autumn haze still prevented them from seeing much in 
other directions. In the west they could not make out either the line of the 
Hedge  or  the  valley of  the Brandywine  beyond  it. Northward, where they 
looked most hopefully, they could see nothing that might be the line of  the 
great East Road, for which they were making. They were on an island in a sea  
of trees, and the horizon was veiled. 
     On the south-eastern  side  the ground fell very  steeply,  as  if  the 
slopes  of  the  hill   were  continued  far  down  under  the  trees,  like 
island-shores that really  are the  sides  of a mountain rising  out of deep 
waters. They sat on the green edge and looked out over the woods below them, 
while they ate their  mid-day meal. As  the sun rose  and  passed  noon they 
glimpsed far  off  in  the east the grey-green lines  of the Downs  that lay 
beyond  the Old Forest on that side. That cheered them greatly; for  it  was 
good to see a sight of anything beyond the  wood's border s,  though they did  
not mean to go  that way,  if  they  could help it: the Barrow-downs  had as 
sinister a reputation in hobbit -legend as the Forest itself.  
     At length they made up their minds  to go on again. The path  that  had 
brought them to the hill reappeared on  the northward side; but they had not  
followed it far before they became aware that it was bending steadily to the 
right.  Soon it  began  to descend  rapidly and they  guessed  that  it must 
actually be heading towards the Withywindle va lley: not at all the direction 
they  wished  lo  take. After some  discussion  they decided to  leave  this 
misleading path and strike northward; for although they had not been able to 
see it  from the hill-top, the Road  must lie that way, and it  could not be 
many miles off. Also northward, and to the left of the path, the land seemed  
lo  be drier  and more  open,  climbing up to slopes  where  the  trees were 
thinner,  and pines and firs replaced the oaks and ashes  and other  strange 
and nameless trees  of the denser wood. 
     At first  their  choice  seemed  to  be good: they got along  at a fair 
speed, though whenever they got  a glimpse of the sun  in an open glade they 
seemed  unaccountably to have veered eastwards. But  after a time the  trees 
began to close in again,  just where they had appeared from a distance to be 
thinner and  less tangled. Then  deep  folds  in  the ground were discovered 

####-unexpectedly, like the ruts of great  giant-wheels or  wide moats and sunken 
roads long disused and choked with  brambles. These lay usually right across 
their  line  of march, and could only be crossed  by scrambling down and out 
again, which was troublesome and difficult with their ponies. Each time they 
climbed down they found the  hollow  filled  with  thick bushes  and  matted 
undergrowth, which somehow would not  yield to the  left, but only  gave way 
when they turned to the right; and they  had to go some  distance along  the 
bottom before they could find a  way up  the  further bank.  Each  time they 
clambered out, the trees seemed deeper and  darker;  and always  to the left 
and upwards it was most difficult to find a way, and they were forced to the  
right and downwards.  
     After an hour or two they had lost all clear sense of direction, though 
they knew well enough that they had long ceased to go northward at all. They 
were being headed off,  and were simply following a course chosen for them - 
eastwards and southwards, into the heart of the Forest and not out of it. 
     The afternoon was wearing away when they scrambled and stumbled  into a  
fold that was  wider and  deeper than any they had yet met. It  was so sleep 
and  overhung that  it proved  impossible  to climb out  of it again, either  
forwards  or  backwards, without  leaving  their ponies  and  their  baggage 
behind. All  they could do  was to  follow  the fold - downwards. The ground 
grew soft, and in places boggy; springs appeared in the banks, and soon they  
found themselves following a brook that trickled and babbled through a weedy 
bed. Then the ground began to fall rapidly, and the brook growing strong and 
noisy, flowed and leaped swiftly downhill. They were in a deep dim-lit gully 
over -arched by trees high above them. 
     After stumbling along for some way along  the  stream, they came  quite 
suddenly out of the gloom. As if through a gate they saw the sunlight before 
them.  Coming  to the opening they found  that they had  made their way down 
through a cleft in a high sleep bank, almost a cliff. At its feet was a wide 
space of grass and reeds; and in the distance could be glimpsed another bank  
almost as  steep. A golden  afternoon  of  late sunshine lay warm and drowsy 
upon  the hidden land between. In the midst of it there wound lazily a  dark 
river  of brown  water,  bordered with ancient  willows,  arched  over  with 
willows, blocked  with fallen willows,  and flecked with thousands  of faded 
willow-leaves.  The  air was thick  with  them, fluttering  yellow from  the 
branches;  for there  was a  warm  and gentle breeze blowing  softly   in the  
valley, and the reeds were rustling, and the willow-boughs were creaking. 

####-     'Well, now I have at  least some  notion  of where we are!' said Merry. 
'We have come almost in the opposite direction to which we intended. This is 
the River Withywindle! I will go on and explore.' 
     He passed out into the sunshine and disappeared into the  long grasses.  
After a while he reappeared, and reported that there was fairly solid ground 
between the cliff-foot and the river; in  some places firm turf went down to 
the water's edge. 'What's more,' he  said, 'there seems to be something like 
a footpath  winding  along on  this side  of the river. If  we turn left and 
follow it, we  shall be bound to  come out on the  east side of  the  Forest 
eventually.' 
     'I dare say!' said Pippin. 'That  is, if the  track goes on so far, and 
does not simply lead us into a bog and leave us there.  Who made  the track, 
do you suppose, and why?  I am sure it was not for our benefit. I am getting  
very suspicious  of this Forest and everything in it, and I begin to believe 
all  the stories about it. And have you any idea how far eastward we  should  
have to go?' 
     'No,' said Merry, 'I  haven't. I don't  know in the  least how far down 
the Withywindle we are, or who could possibly come here often enough to 
make 
a path along it. But there is no other way out that I can see or think of.' 
     There being nothing  else for it, they filed out, and Merry led them to 
the path that he had discovered. Everywhere the reeds and  grasses were lush 
and tall, in places far above their heads; but once found, the path was easy 
to  follow, as it  turned  and twisted, picking out the sounder ground among 
the bogs and pools. Here and there it passed  over other rills, running down 
gullies into the Wi thywindle  out of the higher  forest -lands,  and at these 
points there were tree-trunks or bundles of brushwood laid carefully across.  
     The  hobbits began to feel very hot. There were armies of flies  of all 
kinds buzzing round their  ears, and the afternoon sun was burning  on their 
backs.  At last they  came suddenly into a thin shade;  great grey  branches 
reached across  the  path. Each step forward became more  reluctant than the 
last. Sleepiness seemed to be creeping out of the ground and up their  legs, 
and falling softly out of the air upon their heads and eyes. 
     Frodo  felt his  chin go down and  his head nod. Just in front  of  him 
Pippin fell forward on to his knees.  Frodo halted. 'It's no good,' he heard 
Merry saying. 'Can't go another step  without rest. Must have nap. It's cool 
under the willows. Less flies!' 

####-     Frodo did not like the sound of this. 'Come  on!' he  cried. 'We  can't  
have a  nap yet. We must get clear of the Forest first.' But the others were 
too far gone to care. Besi de them Sam stood yawning and blinking stupidly.  
     Suddenly  Frodo  himself  felt  sleep overwhelming him.  His head swam. 
There now seemed  hardly a sound  in the air. The flies had stopped buzzing. 
Only a gentle noise on the edge of hearing,  a soft  fluttering as of a song 
half whispered, seemed to stir in the boughs above. He lifted his heavy eyes 
and  saw leaning over him a  huge willow-tree,  old  and hoary. Enormous  it  
looked,  its  sprawling  branches  going  up like  reaching  arms with  many 
long-fingered hands,  its knotted and twisted trunk gaping  in wide fissures 
that creaked faintly as the boughs  moved. The leaves fluttering against the 
bright sky dazzled  him,  and he toppled over, lying where  he fell upon the 
grass. 
     Merry and Pippin dragged themselves  forward  and  lay down  with their  
backs to  the willow-trunk.  Behind them  the  great  cracks gaped  wide  to 
receive them as the  tree swayed and creaked. They looked up at the grey and 
yellow leaves, moving softly against the light, and singing. They shut their 
eyes, and  then it seemed  that  they  could almost hear words,  cool words,  
saying something about water and sleep. They gave themselves up to the spell 
and fell fast asleep at the foot of the great grey willow. 
     Frodo   lay for  a while  fighting with  the sleep that was overpowering 
him;  then  with  an  effort  he  struggled  to  his feel again. He  felt  a  
compelling  desire for cool water.  'Wait for me,  Sam,' he  stammered.  'Must  
bathe feet a minute.' 
     Half in a dream he wandered forward to the riverward  side of the tree, 
where great winding roots grew out into the stream, like  gnarled  dragonets 
straining down to drink. He straddled one of these, and paddled his hot feel 
in the cool brown water; and there he too suddenly fell asleep with his back  
against the tree. 
     Sam sat down and  scratched his head, and yawned like a  cavern. He was 
worried.  The  afternoon  was  getting late,  and  he  thought  this  sudden 
sleepiness  uncanny.  'There's more  behind this than sun and warm air,'  he 
muttered  to himself.  'I don't like this great big tree. I  don't trust it. 
Hark at it singing about sleep now! This won't do at all!' 
     He pulled himself to his feet, and staggered off to see what had become 
of the ponies. He found that  two had wandered on a good way along the path; 
and he had just  caught them and brought them back towards the others,  when 

####-he  heard two noises; one loud, and the other  soft but very  clear. One was 
the  splash of something heavy falling into the water; the other was a noise 
like the snick of a lock when a door quietly closes fast. 
     He rushed back to the bank. Frodo was  in the water close to the  edge, 
and a great tree-root seemed to be over him and holding him down, but he was 
not struggling. Sam gripped him by the  jacket, and dragged him  from  under 
the root; and then with difficulty hauled him on to the bank. Almost at once 
he woke, and coughed and spluttered. 
     'Do you know, Sam,' he said at length, 'the beastly tree  threw me in! I 
felt it. The big root just twisted round and tipped me in!' 
     'You were dreaming  I expect, Mr. Frodo,'  said Sam. 'You shouldn't sit 
in such a place, if you feel sleepy.' 
     'What  about the  others?' Frodo asked. 'I wonder  what sort of  dr eams 
they are having.' 
     They went round to the other side of the tree, and  then Sam understood 
the click that he had heard. Pippin  had vanished. The crack by which he had 
laid himself had closed together, so that  not  a chink could be seen. Merry 
was trapped: another crack had closed about his waist; his legs lay outside, 
but the  rest of him was inside a dark opening, the edges of  which  gripped 
like a pair of pincers.  
     Frodo and  Sam beat  first upon the  tree-trunk where Pippin had  lain. 
They then struggled frantically to pull open the jaws of the crack that held 
poor Merry. It was quite useless.  
     'What a  foul thing to happen!' cried Frodo  wildly. 'Why  did  we ever  
come into this dreadful  Forest? I wish we were all back at Crickhollow! ' He 
kicked the tree with all his strength, heedless  of  his own  feet. A hardly 
perceptible shiver ran through the stem and up into the branches; the leaves 
rustled and whispered, but with a sound now of faint and far-off laughter. 
     'I suppose we haven't  got an  axe among our luggage, Mr. Frodo?' asked 
Sam. 
     'I  brought a  little hatchet for chopping firewood,' said Frodo. 'That 
wouldn't be much use.' 
     'Wait a minute!'  cried  Sam, struck by an idea suggested by  firewood. 
'We might do something with fire!' 
     'We might,' said Frodo doubtfully. 'We might succeed in roasting Pippin 
alive inside.' 
 

####- 
     'We might try  to hurt or  frighten  this tree to begin with,' said Sam 
fiercely. 'If it don't let them go,  I'll  have it down,  if  I have to gnaw 
it.' He  ran to the ponies and before  long  came back with two tinder -boxes 
and a hatchet. 
     Quickly they gathered dry grass and leaves, and bits  of bark; and made 
a  pile  of broken twigs and chopped sticks. These  they heaped against  the 
trunk  on the far side of the tree from  the prisoners. As soon  as Sam  had 
struck  a spark into  the tinder,  it kindled the dry grass  and a flurry of 
flame and smoke went up. The  twigs crackled. Little fingers  of fire licked 
against  the dry scored rind of  the ancient tree and scorched  it. A tremor  
ran through the whole  willow. The leaves  seemed to hiss above their  heads 
with a sound of pain and anger. A loud  scream came from Merry, and from far 
inside the tree they heard Pippin give a muffled yell. 
     'Put it out! Put it out!' cried Merry. 'He'll squeeze me in two, if you  
don't. He says so!' 
     'Who?  What?' shouted Frodo,  rushing  round  to  the other side of the 
tree. 
     'Put  it out! Put it  out!'  begged Merry.  The  branches of the wi llow 
began to sway violently. There was a sound as of a wind rising and spreading 
outwards  to the branches of all the other trees round about, as though they 
had  dropped a stone into the quiet slumber  of the river -valley and  set up 
ripples  of anger that  ran out  over the  whole  Forest. Sam kicked at  the 
little fire and stamped out the sparks. But Frodo, without any clear idea of 
why he did so, or what he hoped  for, ran  along the path crying help! help! 
help! It seemed to him that he could hardly hear the sound of his own shrill 
voice: it  was  blown away  from  him by  the willow-wind and drowned  in  a  
clamour of leaves,  as soon as the  words left his mouth. He felt desperate: 
lost and witless.  
     Suddenly  he  slopped.  There was an answer, or  so  he  thought; but it 
seemed  to come from  behind him, away down  the  path  further back in  the 
Forest.  He turned round and listened, and soon  there  could  be no  doubt: 
someone was  singing a song; a deep glad voice  was  singing  carelessly and 
happily, but it was singing nonsense: 
     Hey dol! merry dol! ring a dong dillo! 
     Ring a dong! hop along! fal lal the willow! 
     Tom Bom, jolly Tom, Tom Bombadillo! 

####-     Half hopeful and half afraid of some new danger, Frodo and Sam now both 
stood still. Suddenly  out of  a long string of  nonsense-words (or so  they 
seemed) the voice rose up loud and clear and burst into this song: 
     Hey! Come merry dot! derry dol! My darling! 
     Light goes the weather-wind and the feathered starling. 
     Down  along under Hill, shining in the sunlight, 
     Waiting on the doorstep for the cold starlight, 
     There my pretty lady is. River-woman's daughter, 
     Slender as the willow-wand, clearer than the water. 
     Old Tom Bombadil water-lilies bringing 
     Comes hopping home again. Can you hear him singing? 
     Hey! Come merry dol! deny dol! and merry-o, 
     Goldberry, Goldberry, merry yellow berry-o! 
     Poor old Willow-man, you tuck your roots away! 
     Tom's in a hurry now. Evening will follow day. 
     Tom's going home again water-lilies bringing. 
     Hey! Come derry dol! Can you hear me singing?  
     Frodo  and Sam stood as if enchanted. The wind puffed  out. The  leaves 
hung silently again on stiff branches. There was  another burst of song, and 
then suddenly, hopping and dancing along the path, there  appeared above the 
reeds an old battered hat with a tall crown and a long blue feather stuck in 
the band. With another hop and a bound there came into  view a man, or so it 
seemed.  At any rate he wa s  too large and heavy for a hobbit, if not  quite 
tall enough for one of the Big People, though he made noise enough for  one, 
slumping along with  great yellow  boots on  his  thick legs,  and  charging 
through grass and rushes like a cow going down to  drink. He had a blue coat 
and a long brown beard; his eyes  were blue and bright, and his face was red 
as  a ripe apple, but creased into a hundred  wrinkles of laughter.  In  his 
hands  he carried  on a  large  leaf  as  on a tray  a  small pile  of white 
water -lilies.  
     'Help!' cried  Frodo  and  Sam  running  towards  him with their  hands 
stretched out. 
     'Whoa! Whoa! steady there!' cried the old man, holding up one hand, and 
they  stopped  short, as  if  they  had been  struck stiff. 'Now,  my little 
fellows, where be you a -going to, puffing like a  bellows? What's the matter  
here  then?  Do  you  know who I am? I'm  Tom Bombadil.  Tell me what's 
your 

####-trouble! Tom's in a hurry now. Don't you crush my lilies!' 
     'My friends are caught in the willow-tree,' cried Frodo breathlessly. 
     'Master Merry's being squeezed in a crack!' cried Sam. 
     'What?' shouted Tom Bombadil,  leaping up  in the air. 'Old Man Willow? 
Naught  worse than that, eh? That  can soon  be mended. I know the  tune for 
him.  Old  grey Willow-man! I'll freeze his  marrow cold, if he don't behave 
himself. I'll  sing his roots off. I'll sing a  wind up  and blow  leaf  and 
branch  away.  Old Man  Willow!' Setting down his  lilies carefully  on  the 
grass, he  ran to  the tree. There he saw Merry's feet  still sticking out  - 
the rest had already  been  drawn further inside. Tom  put his mouth to  the 
crack  and  began singing  into it in a  low voice. They could not catch the 
words, but  evidently Merry was aroused. His legs began to kick.  Tom sprang 
away,  and breaking off a hanging branch smote  the side of the  willow with  
it. 'You  let  them  out  again, Old  Man Willow!'  he  said. 'What  be  you  
a-thinking  of? You  should not be waking. Eat earth! Dig deep! Drink water! 
Go to sleep! Bombadil is talking!' He then seized  Merry's feet and drew him 
out of the suddenly widening crack. 
     There was a tearing creak and the other crack split open, and out of it 
Pippin sprang, as if he had been kicked. Then  with  a loud snap both cracks 
closed fast again.  A shudder ran  through  the tree  from root to  tip, and 
complete silence fell. 
     'Thank you!' said the hobbits, one after the other. 
     Tom Bombadil burst out  laughing.  'Well,  my little fellows!' said he, 
stooping  so that he peered into their  faces. 'You shall come home with me!  
The  table is  all laden with  yellow cream, honeycomb, and white bread  and 
butter. Goldberry is  waiting. Time  enough  for questions around the supper  
table. You follow after me as quick as you are able!' With that he picked up 
his  lilies, and then with a beckoning  wave  of  his hand  went hopping and 
dancing along the path eastward, still singing loudly and nonsensically. 
     Too surprised and too relieved to talk, the hobbits followed  a fter him 
as fast as they could. But that was not fast enough. Tom soon disappeared in 
front  of them,  and the noise of his singing got fainter  and further away. 
Suddenly his voice came floating back to them in a loud halloo!  
     Hop along, my little friends, up the Withywindle! 
     Tom's going on ahead candles for to kindle. 
     Down west sinks the Sun: soon you will be groping. 
     When the night-shadows fall, then the door will open, 

####-     Out of the window-panes light will twinkle yellow.  
     Fear no alder black! Heed no hoary willow! 
     Fear neither root nor bough! Tom goes on before you. 
     Hey now! merry dot! We'll be waiting for you! 
     After that the hobbits heard  no more. Almost at once the sun seemed to 
sink  into  the  trees  behind them. They thought of the slanting  light  of 
evening glittering on the  Brandywine River, and  the windows  of Bucklebury 
beginning  to gleam with hundreds of lights. Great shadows fell across them; 
trunks and branches of trees hung  dark and threatening over the path. White  
mists began to rise and curl on the surface of the river and stray about the 
roots  of the trees upon its borders. Out of the very ground at their feet a  
shadowy steam arose and mingled with the swiftly falling dusk. 
     It became difficult to follow the path, and they were very tired. Their 
legs seemed leaden. Strange furtive noises ran among the bushes and reeds on 
either  side of them; and if  they looked  up  to the pale sky,  they caught 
sight  of  queer  gnarled  and knobbly  faces that gloomed dark against  the 
twilight,  and leered down at them  from the high bank and the edges of  the 
wood. They  began to feel that  all this  country was unreal,  and that they 
were stumbling through an ominous dream that led to no awakening. 
     Just as they felt their feet slowing down to a standstill, they noticed 
that the  ground  was  gently  rising.  The  water  began to murmur. In  the 
darkness they caught the white glimmer of foam, where the  river flowed over  
a short fall. Then suddenly the trees came to an end and the mists were left  
behind. They  stepped out from the  Forest, and found a wide sweep  of grass 
welling up before them. The  river, now small and swift, was leaping merrily 
down to meet them, glinting here and there in the light of the stars,  which 
were already shining in the sky. 
     The grass under their feet was smooth and short, as if it had been mown 
or shaven. The eaves of the Forest behind were clipped, and trim as a hedge. 
The path was now plain before  them, well-tended and bordered with stone. It 
wound  up on to the top  of a grassy knoll,  now grey under  the pale starry 
night; and there,  still high  above them  on a further slope, they saw  the 
twinkling lights of a house. Down again the path went, and then up aga in, up 
a  long smooth  hillside of  turf, towards the light. Suddenly a wide yellow 
beam  flowed out  brightly  from a  door  that  was  opened.  There  was Tom 
Bombadil's  house  before them, up,  down,  under hill. Behind  it  a  steep 
shoulder of the land  lay grey and bare,  and beyond that the dark shapes of 

####-the Barrow-downs stalked away into the eastern night. 
     They  all hurried  forward,  hobbits  and  ponies. Already  half  their 
weariness  and all their fears  had fallen from them. Hey! Come  merry  dol! 
rolled out the song to greet them. 
     Hey! Come derry dol! Hop along, my hearties! 
     Hobbits! Ponies all! We are fond of parties. 
     Now let the fun begin! Let us sing together! 
     Then  another clear voice, as young and as ancient as Spring, like  the 
song of a glad water flowing  down  into  the night from a bright morning in 
the hills, came falling like silver to meet them: 
     Now let the song begin! Let us sing together 
     Of sun, stars, moon and mist, rain and cloudy weather, 
     Light on the budding leaf, dew on the feather, 
     Wind on the open hill, bells on the heather, 
     Reeds by the shady pool, lilies on the water: 
     Old Tom Bombadil and the River-daughter! 
     And  with that song the hobbits stood upon  the threshold, and a golden 
light was all about them.
